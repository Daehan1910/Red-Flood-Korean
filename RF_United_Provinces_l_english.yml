#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
UPI_brutal_colonizer:0 "잔혹한 식민주의자"
UPI_brutal_colonizer_desc:0 "A brutal man who would rather see a dozen dead over one protestor, it has become the speciality of Winston Churchill to put down the revolts of the United Probinces with violence instead of words."

UPI_winston_churchill:0 "The man responsible for butchery in Gallipoli, where ANZAC forces were gunned down for no gain. The tyrant behind the chemical weapons used in the Middle East. The dictator of India, where entire villages vanish. Winston Churchill is a broken man, who cannot stand the blood he drowns in every day. What will happen to poor Winston? He is propelled forwards by nothing but the expectation that more pain-dulling whiskey is on the horizon, not seeing the knives sharpening around him."

UPI_avatar_desc:0 "No one knows where this bold, charismatic woman came. She came chanting, she came shouting, she came telling the Indians that they had stumbled upon divine truths. Over time, a mess, a total and complete mess of pseudo-religion, ideology, a personality cult, and ultimately just thousands of people needing some manifestation of hope to cling to. This exploitation of fear, anger, and hate, with a veneer of justification in mis-remembered and outright lied-about theology, became the Avatar Cult, lead by a Goddess who shall drown the world in blood."

#IDEAS#

UPI_alone_unsupplied_cutoff:0 "Alone, Unsupplied and Cut-off"
UPI_alone_unsupplied_cutoff_desc:0 "We are relying more and more on internal manufacture, and the high-quality Lee-Enfields our soldiers are used to are slowly being replaced by home-grown gun designs. Manufacturing problems aside, they're often nowhere near as well-liked."

UPI_civil_obedience:0 "시민불복종"

UPI_freedom_assembly_desc:0 "Everyone should be able to discuss their ideas in the marketplace of thought - the best will rise to the top, the rest can be discarded.

UPI_reunion_fervour_desc:0 "The people of the United Provinces want to reunite India, they adore Churchill, and the fervor for reunification grows and grows as our achievements pile. The fruits of success are manifold, how shall we eat them all?"
UPI_british_tigers:0 "처칠의 범들"
UPI_british_tigers_desc:0 "Churchill's Tigers are the Indians who see our rule as just, and are willing to bleed for Churchill. They are small in number, but their example shall inspire more."
UPI_new_indian:0 "새 인도인"
UPI_new_indian_desc:0 "We are transforming India, one soul at a time. The savagery is sloughing off, the anger and hate they feel is dripping away like snow in the sun. Soon, all their savage ways shall be extinct."

UPI_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "Anyone’s opinions are free to be peddled in the marketplace of ideas, for those that are unattractive to India, those extreme ideas that manifest from anger and hate of the wealthy or the colour of skin or the faith one professes, those shall never go far in our new society. Cooler heads shall always prevail."
UPI_controlled_parties:0 "정당 통제"
