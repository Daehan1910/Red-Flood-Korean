ukraine_mikhnovsky_scandal:0 "Mikhnovsky's scandal"
ukraine_mikhnovsky_scandal_desc:0 "Mykola Mikhnovsky used to be a great statesman. He was one of those people who supported Ukrainian independence and irredentism before it became mainstream. His pamphlet 'Independent Ukraine' became an undisputed bestseller both among the Left and among the Right. However, the Great War and humiliation caused by loss of Left-bank Ukraine broke him, and now Mikhnovsky is little more than a buffoon, re-elected simply due to his past deeds. Today however, he became an embarrassment, when he ranted from the podium about imminent doom and that half of the parliament are closet German agents. What shall be done now?"
ukraine_information_fake:0 "Democracy Must Continue"
ukraine_information_fake_desc:0 "Obviously, what Mikhnovsky said is...not even a lie, it’s simply nonsense and slander. Our democracy is as healthy as it can get, but now thanks to one jingoistic clown we’re having a vote of no confidence against USDRP government. Some may say that this is beginning of a crisis. Meanwhile, UDKhP member of parliament Fedir Lyzohub said that we may have escaped an even more dire situation."
ukraine_snap_election:0 "1936 Snap Elections"
ukraine_snap_election_desc:0 "When secret police didn’t reveal anything suspicious replying to Mikhnovsky’s request, but Petliura still insisted on carrying out elections 'for the sake of our democracy', the parliament had to agree. After all, the competition has started already, and it is likely that new Rada will be different from the previous."
ukraine_socialist_victory:0 "UPSR Revisionist Socialist Victory"
ukraine_socialist_victory_desc:0 "Mykhailo Hrushevsky and his sworn comrades of Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries have finally achieved plurality of seats in Rada. While the government is being swiftly taken over by UPSR ministers, Hrushevsky has defeated his opponents and is going to be inaugurated as a second president of Ukraine. Both Intermarium and Internationale are waiting, because Hrushevsky’s views seem to be strangely alike with those held both in Poland and Germany, and public at home too waits reforms, but let our new President - and the author of bestseller history books - speak on this matter on his own."
ukraine_rapid_land_reform:0 "Rapid Land Reform"
ukraine_rapid_land_reform_desc:0 "Peasants, rejoice! No longer will your kid ask you at the evening: 'Dad, when we will get our soil?'! For after passing this law, every peasant family will get a share of remaining landowners’ land, and it will be fully paid by the state, no peasant contribution needed! This land will be your private possession, obviously, but if you wish to contribute to our Revolution, then voluntary cooperation between independent farmers is always an option."
ukraine_calm_elites:0 "Calm the Elites"
ukraine_calm_elites_desc:0 "What we need to explain to the high society that provides most of financing to our rival parties, and that instinctively fears the words 'socialist' and 'councilist', is that we are not Communists, and our Socialism doesn’t involve total seizure of assets by the state. Our Socialism is first of all for the Peasants, and it’s not a 'Dictatorship of the Proletariat'."
ukraine_slow_industrialization:0 "Slow Industrialization"
ukraine_slow_industrialization_desc:0 "While it is no doubt that Right-bank Ukraine is industrially less developed than Halychyna or Left-bank Ukraine, it would be harmful to our society to pursue the industrialization at all costs. More so, to industrialize quicker we would need either a helping hand of bourgeoisie - and that would compromise our socialistic ideals, or a nearly total state control - and that would make us look like the very “Red Menace” everyone talks now about."
ukraine_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
ukraine_market_socialism_desc:0 "Who said that Socialism automatically means planned allocation of resources? Even we, arguably the most far-left faction in the Parliament, have nothing against market - after all, it used to be a part of our culture for many centuries, and market’s existence doesn’t contradict the expansion of socialist forms of ownership. Which is why our Socialism is Market Socialism. "
ukraine_table_partisans:0 "Round-Table with Partisans"
ukraine_table_partisans_desc:0 "We may not be able to assert military control over temporarily occupied lands on the Left bank of Dnipro on our own, but fortunately, there is a tool just for that - partisans, various anarchists and nationalists loosely unified around figure of Nestor Makhno, who used to be a die-hard anarchist but by now has reconciled with us. We shall host a secret conference of partisan leaders, where a plan of “New Russia’s” downfall will be crafted."
ukraine_artist_apolitical:0 "Make our Artistic Renaissance Apolitical"
ukraine_artist_apolitical_desc:0 "The biggest problem about our various Modernists, Futurists, Cubists, Surrealists and other -ists is that while they are brilliant artists, writers and poets, they’re also a bit too much individualistic, and have unfortunate infatuation with France - a counterrevolutionary, oppressive country. While we are not Communists to conduct purges, we can urge our artists to retire from politics, perhaps by incorporating their work to our own propaganda."
ukraine_slightly_red:0 "A Slightly Red Ukraine"
ukraine_slightly_red_desc:0 "With our socialistic transformation underway, Land Reform swiftly completed, the Rich slowly integrated into our Socialist society as it should be, and cause of social liberation expected to be expanded to other lands inhabited by Ukrainians, we can say for sure that Ukraine that was - a capitalistic, bourgeois republic -, and a Ukraine we are ruling over right now - a land of socialism, a republic of labouring masses - are two different realities. Perhaps, our opponents calling us “Reds” may be right after all…"
ukraine_liberal_victory:0 "UNDO-UPSF Liberal Coalition"
ukraine_liberal_victory_desc:0 "Triumph of freedom! Ukrainian people have elected a new, Liberal coalition to rule the government. With Liberal plurality in the parliament, and the President expected to be either Dmytro Doroshenko, known diplomat, historian and leader of Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists, or Yevhen Petrushevych, well-mannered gentleman from Polish-controlled but Ukrainian-populated lands, the future of Ukraine is certain to be vibrant and a bit unpredictable."
ukraine_economic_freedom:0 "UNDO: Economic Freedom"
ukraine_economic_freedom_desc:0 "Ukrainian National-Democratic Alliance, known also as 'Ob’yednannya' is a Market Liberal party, whose leader Yevhen Petrushevych was chosen by coalition agreement as the next president of Ukraine. Investors are already looking at our country with much less suspicion than before, and liberation of market from the state’s paws is expected to come any day now, but certain circles in Poland have expressed doubt in Petrushevych’s bias in diplomacy. Nonetheless, Ukraine is expected to become a land of economic freedom."
ukraine_human_rights:0 "UPSF: Human Rights"
ukraine_human_rights_desc:0 "Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists, while bearing 'Socialist' in its name, is actually just Social Liberal, and 'Federalist' comes from the time when this party existed semi-legally during the last days of Russian Imperial rule in Right-bank Ukraine. The party, led by newly inaugurated president Dmytro Doroshenko, states that further centralization, fight against corruption and protection of human rights shall be the keystone of Ukrainian politics for the next seven years, earning approval from nations such as Italy, Britain and USA."
ukraine_free_market:0 "Implement the Free Market"
ukraine_free_market_desc:0 "When our country achieved independence, its Social-Democratic leadership was still partially under a Marxist illusion that capital is a force of evil. While they didn’t deny the usefulness of market economy, they imposed on it too many restrictions, that didn’t help a bit and only led to rampant corruption and cronyism in border guards and customs’ service. We shall make the businesses in Ukraine more free to breathe, and what will follow is most certainly an economic boom, a thing achievable only if we provide the freedom our petty bourgeoisie so craves for."
ukraine_promise_autonomy:0 "Promise Ashkenazim Autonomy"
ukraine_promise_autonomy_desc:0 "Ukraine is a country of Ukrainians, but it has quite a few minorities as well. Granted our current location and unfortunately small span of the country, our largest minority is not Russians, not Polish and not even Moldovan people. Our largest, arguably the most useful, and undeniably heavily discriminated against minority is the Jews. And, while we could limit our help to them by simply cracking down on discrimination, we could borrow a useful thought or two from the Austromarxists and grant the Ashkenazi populace a kind of 'National-Personal Autonomy' - all Jews could join a non-governmental organization tasked with providing education in Yiddish and defending the civil rights of Jewish minority, and perhaps this organization could even delegate a nonpartisan minister to the government."
ukraine_customs_union:0 "Free Customs Union within Intermarium"
ukraine_customs_union_desc:0 "Liberal ideals of Free Trade is one thing, but being unable to implement them even with your closest allies is another! Today, we shall end this absurd state of things, as our government and ministers of other countries in the Intermarium will sign a historically important document - a particularly liberal free trade and free customs union! No longer shall our people pay thrice for products from our neighbors, while those worrying about Ukrainian products no longer being sold on marketplaces of Berestya or Krakow as expensive as it used to be forget about existence of other markets, not yet explored by our tradesmen. Which, combined with that it would be easier for tourists to visit our beautiful country, only makes a case for optimism."
ukraine_mandatory_education:0 "Ensure Mandatory Education in Ukrainian"
ukraine_mandatory_education_desc:0 "The biggest plague in Ukraine’s history was arguably neither of the infective diseases, nor the loss of statehood on its own, but the seemingly irreparable damage done to people’s self-consciousness by enserfment of the peasantry, which led to generations after generations of our people being unable to attain education. Seemingly irreparable...it seemed, until now. For while our coalition government is Liberal, and we respect the individual rights and personal initiative, the matter of education is something that must be made compulsory and state-directed. All children in our country from six to eighteen years must attend state schools, where they will study according to modern curriculum, and they will do it only in Ukrainian, leading to inevitable assimilation of non-Ukrainians into a greater Ukrainian nation, combined with better productiveness of our people overall."
ukraine_liberal:0 "A Yellow Ukraine"
ukraine_liberal_desc:0 "Trade is blooming, enterprise after enterprise improves its operations, wealth is being created by our hard-working citizens, civil rights are as strong as they ever could be, and national unity through civic education and linguistic uniformity combined with personal freedoms shall be abound in our Ukraine, our land of freedom."
ukraine_conservative_victory:0 "UDKhP Conservative Government"
ukraine_conservative_victory_desc:0 "Vyacheslav Lypynsky, leader of Ukrainian Democratic-”Khliborob” (Peasant) Party is now the President of Ukraine. Conservatives in power are for the first time in the history of modern Ukraine, so understandably many people have found something to criticize the new government, one flaw or another. Left-wing politicians have expressed concern over a landowner of not-so-secret Polish ancestry coming to power after a chain of Social-Democratic governments, Mikhnovsky and some other fringe right-wingers were alarmed by UDKhP’s policies, some of which seem to be inspired by Stolypin’s reign, but in his first speech Lypynsky debunked most of allegations thrown at him by press, saying that he supports Ukrainian national interests over private interests of the richest, and that he and his party will commit themselves to strengthening Ukrainian democracy."
ukraine_negotiate_landlords:0 "Negotiate with Landlords"
ukraine_negotiate_landlords_desc:0 "Using our ties to aristocratic and land-owning elites still prevalent in most of the countryside, we can, no, we will persuade them to invest into the people’s wellbeing by surrendering most of the land at low price rather than provoking further rural unrest. This will also make our elites more interested in aggressive foreign policy, granted how in our manifesto we didn’t mention that we would conduct land reform in the lands not under our rule."
ukraine_education_reform:0 "Massive Education Reform"
ukraine_education_reform_desc:0 "The biggest plague in Ukraine’s history was arguably neither of the infective diseases, nor the loss of statehood on its own, but the seemingly irreparable damage done to national self-consciousness by enserfment of the Cossacks, which led to generations after generations of our people being unable to read and write. Seemingly irreparable...it seemed, until now. Our government protects democratic ideals, we respect the individual rights and personal initiative, but the matter of education is something that must be made compulsory and state-directed. All children in our country from six to eighteen years must attend state schools, where they will study according to modern curriculum, and they will do it only in Ukrainian, leading to inevitable assimilation of non-Ukrainians into a greater Ukrainian nation. No funds shall be spared, because the question here is the one of our future."
ukraine_stoly:0 "Ukrainian Stolypinianism"
ukraine_stoly_desc:0 "Stolypin may have been an enemy of Ukraine and basically everything non-Russian, but he must be credited with forging a system, that with slight amendments could improve our productivity, make the progress easier and guarantee the nation’s strength. After all, it is in Ukraine’s spirit to adopt those practices of our enemies that would make us stronger. Like how old Kievan Rus’ adopted Byzantine armour, like how the Cossacks have become fearsome cavalrymen thanks to adoption of Tatar tactics, the way how our kinsman have bended the system of Austria to Ukrainian community’s interests, we will propel our nation to greatness by introducing Ukrainian version of Stolypinianism!"
ukraine_anti_socialism:0 "Promote Anti-Socialist Views"
ukraine_anti_socialism_desc:0 "'Red Bonaparte' Muravyov used to be an average far-left thug, leading a regiment of Republican soldiers to plunder the Left-bank Ukraine, before betraying his own allies and becoming an attack dog of Drozdovsky, earning the infamous 'Butcher of Kyiv' nickname during the brief occupation of our capital by Drozdovites. His story is just one of the many similar stories, which depict the sheer cruelty that the cancerous ideologies of total state control can lead the man to, 'Communism', 'Socialism' or 'Councilism' - doesn’t matter how you call it, experience shows that those ideologies can’t claim moral superiority over existing Ukrainian democracy. Perhaps, our alliance with major publishing houses will solve this issue."
ukraine_military_industrial_complex:0 "Expand War Industry"
ukraine_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "One of the most effective weapons against nation’s enemies is, well, weapons. We must expand our existing military-industrial complex, until we could recapture our eastern territories and fuel the war machine with even more resources."
ukraine_fiscal_responsibility:0 "Fiscal Responsibility"
ukraine_fiscal_responsibility_desc:0 "An educated person is less likely to expect the state to act akin to nanny. Our bureaucrats used to toe a pretty dangerous line of irresponsible budget accounting, leading to frequent underfunding of major government agencies. Fiscal reforms, responsibility for the state of financial affairs, and government control over the flow of money - this is what will make our economy even more productive!"
ukraine_democratic:0 "A Blue Ukraine"
ukraine_democratic_desc:0 "Conservative nature of our society organically unites with our understanding of Ukrainian dream. Democracy has finally being achieved, and even if other nations won’t follow our example, we are the undeniable beacon of democracy in the whole Eastern Europe - a beacon to last as long as we believe in democratic values."
ukraine_socdem_victory:0 "USDRP Social Democrats: Status Quo"
ukraine_socdem_victory_desc:0 "What was shall be, what shall be was, and there’s nothing new under the Sun. With such Biblical words, an opposition newspaper commented on USDRP yet another victory. Symon Petliura got re-elected for the second time, this being his third term into presidency. While obviously, Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labour Party may comment otherwise, for the rather not-so-silent minority Petliura’s continuous victory seems to be more of a curse than a blessing. People who vote for Petliura are often ridiculed for being indifferent to the country’s territorial integrity. But it seems so, that people simply can’t be changed, and status quo, briefly shaken by Mikhnovsky’s scandalous behaviour, shall resume."
ukraine_slow_education_reform:0 "Slowly Reform Education"
ukraine_slow_education_reform_desc:0 "Education...a pressing matter, sure, and optimally we should have made it compulsory and universal a long time ago, but there is simply no need to rush. With the plan drafted by our Ministry of Education in collaboration with Ministry of Interior and Department of Railroad Workers’ Security of Ministry of Labour Relations, it is expected that by 1960, between 80 and 90 percents of our population will be literate and able to compete with foreign workforce."
ukraine_invest_industry:0 "Invest in Industry"
ukraine_invest_industry_desc:0 "Industrial workers are overrepresented in the government, but we can handle it. Industrial investments will help us to modernize our nation, to satisfy the needs of our consumers, and to, as a hidden bonus, to increase the size of our urban electorate."
ukraine_almighty_met:0 "The Almighty Metodychka"
ukraine_almighty_met_desc:0 "Various lies told about our government in the bourgeois press, on radio and even on the invention for the urban rich - television - are something that we can’t stand. No more. And it seems that the best solution, instead of outright censorship (which would harm our publicity) would be issuing 'methodical brochures' to the journalists, - books containing guidelines on what should be highlighted in a news report, and what should be left aside."
ukraine_finish_land_reform:0 "Finish Land Reform"

ukraine_egalitarian_technocracy_desc:0 "We are the Technocrats, but our rule is not the one of some bishop-like ancient fools who sit in ivory towers while ignoring the people. Egalitarianism helps to eliminate the inefficiencies of bourgeois system, while also granting us the people’s gratitude."
ukraine_rule_world:0 "...Is When You Rule the World"
ukraine_rule_world_desc:0 "It is obvious that our nation doesn’t have the resources required for true autarky. This is what our rivals have said to us all the time. What had they ignored, and what we will gladly use both for our party’s and our nation’s benefit is that there is a really easy solution for this problem - we must conquer all lands in any way associated with Greater Ukraine, install puppet governments where we could (and where there are too few Ukrainians to properly annex those lands), and make a strong coalition with those whom we deem worthy to do so."

ukraine_haven_dissidents_desc:0 "Achieving our nation’s greatness can be done even if not all of our top researchers would be born in Ukraine. More so - by granting asylum to hundreds (if not thousands) of persecuted scientists, intellectuals and political dissidents from nations still stuck in the past, we will drain their strength while enriching our own potential."

ukraine_seek_alliances_desc:0 "Fortunately, we are not alone in our quest for brighter future. The so-called 'Accelerationist' movement part of which we are is pretty broad, but all who claim akin to us to battle against backwardness and reaction are welcome in our alliance - an alliance for the global superiority of reason over dumb fear of unknown."
ukraine_civic_nationalism:0 "Enlightened Civic Nationalism"
ukraine_civic_nationalism_desc:0 "After so many things done to our nation’s improvement by people who weren’t 'fortunate' enough to be born Ukrainian, we have to say: it doesn’t matter where you are born, or even what are your cultural tastes, as long as you are a loyal citizen of Ukraine who cares enough to learn Ukrainian language and aid Ukrainian struggle against reactionaries, you’re always welcome and you will be accepted as Ukrainian. If we show the people around the world our enlightened ways, then perhaps we will face less resistance from the nations we would occupy."
ukraine_reforge_everything:0 "Our Purpose is to Reforge Everything"
ukraine_reforge_everything_desc:0 "Reforged may be our country, but it is not enough! The world will bow before our steel, before our wit, before our ascended knowledge, and from the peaks of Lemkovyna to the shores of Okhotsk Sea will the Global Hegemony of Ukraine stand - a testament to human will, a forge where every single aspect of reality will be reforged to be more efficient and bring the Humanity to the much, much better future."
