alt.5.desc:0 "Gaining secular power in the state doesn't mean gaining heart and minds of the people. Just because we can order them doesn't mean we can touch their souls. This is why education and spiritual guidance is of most importance.\n Everyone from city centres to most secluded villages must be exposed to as much wisdom as possible. After long deliberations it was decided to form a group of traveling teachers who will spread to the all corners of Altay the news of coming of Ak-Burkhan. Every man, woman and child needs to be ready for Him."

alt.6.desc:0 "Not everyone's eyes are open to see the truth and not all hearts are open to the coming of White Buddha. Many so-called shamans blind to the glory of the incoming Savior took arms against his followers. They are weak and their numbers small, not enought to cause a real uprising. But they were still a nuisance and an afront to Ak-Burkhan. When He comes Altay needs to be clean from filth, hooves of his white horse shall not be soiled with taint of unbelievers.\nThey died, either with weapons in hands or perished in purging flames of our justice, He cared not what fate befell them.\nThe rebellious shamans, the partisans, the filth soiling the ground just before His coming... All gone now."

alt.7.desc:0 "Greed and love of material things has no place in Altay. Disloyal aristocrats, landlords, money holders... all of them care for their own pockets not for the New Age coming upon us. Did they dreamt dreams of Ak-Burkhan? Did they saw vissions of his coming? No, their eyes and their spirits were blinded by money and greed. This shall end. Riches shall be taken away from those who have too much and used for pious goals. No man shall be suffering hunger and cold when few grow fat and lazy or else all of them will be distracted from the great works in the future."

alt.8.desc:0 "Preparations started way before we even came into power. Years of studying, meditation, gathering required artifacts. All of that finally pays off.\nThe Great Ritual starts, hundreds of shamans, untold masses of collectivised proletarians. All gathered to fulfill historical mission. Unforgiving rules of Historical Meta-Materialism made this very moment unavoidable. We are instrument of it, the Red Stick striking the Drum of Future Generations.\nChants fill, the air, fires light the night sky with red haze. The sign of things to come.\nThe Russian Revolution failed. Many wondered why for many years. Was it too strong role of the vanguard party? Too weak one? Wrong leaders? Wrong commanders? All questions asked were in vein. Blinded by bourgeois reductionism fools did not see that it is not just raw matter we were fighting against. Bourgeoisie is deeper and stronger foe that cannot be beaten by shooting it enought times. It's a thing of meta-mater and only by Meta-materialistic Dialectics can it be beaten!\nThe chants reach apogeum almost deafening with strength of proletarian lungs, fires burning hot, make air warm and hard to breathe in. None of that matters. The ecstasy of victory, the ectasy of collectivised thought makes the unrelenting mass of humanity continue.\nFlames throw shaking light on gathered around them visages of the men who brought us here. Marx and Engels look from beyond the grave with unearthly powers dancing in their eyes. Yes, truly we are acomplising what others said could acomplished be not.\nThe chants turn into yell of ecstasy and anguish, of capitalist contradictions leaving bodies of the gathered... Then silence.\nCommanded by historical necessity the crowd stops, the chanting ends. The shamans, the proletariat, all cath their breath and look upon their work.  All over four corners of the Earth unbeknownst to everyone uninitiated a great curse befell the bourgeoisie. The contradictions shall become impossible to deal with, the class struggle shall grow stronger and stronger. The bourgeoisie false morality will fall, the false counciousness will be lifted from eyes of proletariat like a veil of lies."

We gather today on it's shores today to give it thanks for giving life to our bodies just like teachings of Marx and Engels give life to our spirits.\nWe take boats, move towards the open, calm deepths of the lake bringing our chants, prayers and rythm of shamanistic drums. We give our thanks and pleed for help in the next year. May calm waters of the Baikal be kind to us proletarians in the future as they were in the past."

But today we know exact date, everyone can see it in callendar. This is the day that historical neccesity made the date of our victory. Our enemies lie beaten before us. Our struggle is bringing fruit. Our lands are many, people liberated by us cannot be counted. Armies of reaction and bourgeoisie were annihilated, their riches redistributed. Their false consciousness crushed and refuted. \nToday we celebrate for we proclaim our victory.

alt.11.desc:0 "그리고리 라스푸틴, once known throughout Russia as the true power behind the throne, the lover of the Russian Tsarina, and quite possibly a man possessed by Satan himself, has amassed a great power base for himself in the small breakaway state of Altay. \n\n It’s not exactly known how he escaped the authorities of either the Reds or the Whites, but he has, and he has now achieved something that many people have always thought his goal – Tsardom. \n\n Declaring himself ‘The Great Lover, the Holy Sinner-Tsar, and great Transgressor,’ he has declared the birth of the Rasputin Dynasty, and legitimized no less than a dozen bastard sons and daughters as his heirs. But that alone is only half the story, for he has been coronated in the capital city of his new Tsardom, Gorno-Altaysk. Silks, gold, silver, alcohol from as far away as Japan and Germany pouring in, alongside all manner of local brews, general havoc and chaos and the likely creation of yet another bastard of the Rasputin dynasty, all happened in the typically atypical Rasputin fashion. Long live the Tsar, long live Sin, long live Altay!"

alt.12.title:0 "The Fête of Fetish"
alt.12.desc:0 "In the new Atlay, in Rasputin’s Atlay, there is nothing sacred – for sin itself is sacred. The conduit of Jesus’s forgiveness is not through perfectionism, not through Skoptsy’s method of forcing one’s self into restraint and following the Book and its Words. No, instead, our communion is one of the flesh, our praises to God are gifts to the One Below, for only through our sin, our trespasses, may the Lord forgive us! Every man, every woman, every child in Atlay knows, or should know, the words to the greatest prayer Jesus ever gave – forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive those who Trespass against us! \n\n To this end, the great, wise, Rasputin and his priests have organized an event that we can only describe as a celebration of Christ, as was intended but denied to him for centuries! This glorious day, there are men and women copulating upon the cross, there are ascetics whipping themselves, both literally and figuratively, into a frenzy of passion for the first time in their wasted lives, there are unspeakable things everywhere, things that shall only be repeated between a confessor and the confessed, before God’s holy blessing is doled out like alms to us poor, lustful humans. Dances, held until people’s feet are bloody and sore, eating and drinking competitions, held until the victor is himself comatose, and prayer sessions, held until the people screaming Christ’s glories are hoarse and cannot speak save to ask for more vodka, all are happening, and all will keep happening, for if this is Rasputin’s new Atlay, it is here to stay!"

alt.13.title:0 "알타이 예술학파"
alt.13.desc:0 "Rasputin has been a patron of art for some time in Altay, and after assuming proper power, it is only right that he continue that patronage – in fact, he has established the Russian Academy for Arts, recognizing a continuity of his work and the work of the artists of Altay with the Russians, and implicitly inviting all those rejected, dejected souls from the Russian empire, from the Socialist Realists who escaped purges to the Mladrossi whose radical works were too much for either side in the war to take, to the native Atlayans, the Mongols and Tuvans who wish to see their cultures preserved, all are welcome at this academy, where art is a means to an end, where the artist is free, unbound by all who might wish to impose a vision upon the radical, where tradition is alive alongside deeply unorthodox works of art, where the Escadron may paint vivid violent slashes across the canvas alongside delicate ritualistic art of a throat-singing Shaman. All, from within and without of Atlay, are welcome, so open the doors, let the people sing, let the paint fly, for the time of the artist is nigh!"
