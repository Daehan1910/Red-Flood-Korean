BRA_DESC_MENU:0 "브라질은 인터내셔널의 등대이지만 연약한 존재입니다. 1935년 말 어르망두 살리스 아래서 붕괴해가던 구 공화국을 박살낸 파자마 혁명 이후, 1차 혁명평의회의 등장에도 전국의 인민은 각자의 이상적 목표에 도달하고자 계략을 꾸몄습니다. 점차 뜯겨나가는 남아메리카의 거인, 커피나라의 미래는 어떻게 될까요?"

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_Anarchy_DESC:0 "민간정부가 지역 과두정자들의 싸움터 수준으로 전락하면서, 중앙정부의 모든 외관은 정부 그 자체의 추상에 불과하게 되었습니다."
POLITICS_AQUINO_DESC:0 "마투 그로수의 쿠야바에서 1885년에 태어난 돈 보스코 살레시오회의 프란시스쿠 지 아키누 쿠러이어는 쿠야바, 포르투 벨류, 리우 브렁쿠와 같은 서부 지역에서 가장 가난한 이들을 대변하며 자기 주변의 사회에 지대한 영향을 끼쳤습니다. 마투 그로수 출신의 위대한 시인이자 작가이기도 한 그는 평등주의적 전언을 통해 전국의 빈자들에게 막대한 종교적 영향력을 갖게 됐으며, 파자마 혁명이 벌어질 당시엔 과두정자들을 향한 성전을 부르짖으며, 대주교로서 현지 성직자들을 동원해 마투 그로수, 롱동니어, 어머조너스와 같은 향촌 지역을 확보하는 데 도움을 주었습니다. 아키누는 천주교 가치들을 통해 빈자들을 도와 평화로운 브라질을 세우려는 한편, 사회정책에 있어선 온건책을 유지하고자 합니다. 11918년부터 1922년까지 마투 그로수 관치를 통해 정치적 경험을 쌓기도 한 그는 일대에서의 문화 발전에도 깊은 영향을 주었습니다. 이제, 브라질의 빈자들을 감복시킨 그의 심오한 사회 및 종교적 전언을 통해 선출되어 브라질 구제위원회의 꼭대기에 선 아키누는, 자신의 이상향적-시적 시점에 맞추어 자신의 관념들을 발전시키고자 합니다."
POLITICS_AMAZONAS_DESC:0 "파라의 벨렝이에서 태어난 주엉우 어머조너스는 브라질의 사회주의적 정치상황이 낳은 아주 새로운 인물이었지만, 그의 등장시점은 완벽했습니다. 러시아 혁명의 실패 이래 세계 최초이자 마지막 공산당들 중 하나인 브라질 공산당에서 입당한 어머조너스는 found himself in an increasingly libertarian surrounding, and then, with the Pajama Revolution, he quickly got to work helping the PCdoB rise up against the Government in the Pará-Northeast area, and helped urban areas in the Northeast rise up against the oligarchs which held them for decades in near-slavery, or basically slavery, and he went to work in ensuring that the Vanguardist voice wouldn't be silenced by the vile Syndicalists which plagued the Conselho de Salvação Nacional. 마르크스주의자이자 레닌주의자인 그는 러시아에서 세워졌던 것과 같은 볼셰비크 국가의 설립이 사회주의의 가장 올바른 길이라 깊게 믿고 있으며, 또한 급진적 전체주의 및 호전성을 통해서만, 브라질의 독립 이래 한 세기가 넘도록 사회를 억압해온 과두정자들을 걷어차고, 비명지르게 하고, 쓸어낼 수 있을 거라 생각합니다."
#IDEAS#
BRA_oligarchic_madness:0 "과두정의 광기"
BRA_oligarchic_madness_desc:0 "브라질 내의 많은 정치권력자들은 선출 관료나 군사지휘관들이 아니라, 자기들만의 봉건적 봉토와 민병대, 어떤 경우엔 자체 화폐까지 지닌 지역 대령들입니다. 브라질이 번영하려면 이 상황부터 바뀌어야 합니다."
BRA_local_army:0 "현지 군조직들"
BRA_local_army_desc:0 "브라질군은 더 이상 하나의 기관으로서 실재하지 않습니다. 각 주는 현지 총독과 그를 지지하는 과두정자들이 통제하는 각자의 군대를 가지고 있습니다. 이러한 구조적 자치가 내분과 탈선을 일반되게 했습니다."
BRA_revolutionary_scars:0 "혁명의 상처들"
BRA_revolutionary_scars_desc:0 "파자마 정변은 우리 정부를 향한 큰 거부감, 공포, 증오를 남겼습니다. 브라질이 혁명공화국으로서 제대로 작동하려면 인민의 생각과 마음을 얻어야 합니다."
BRA_famine:0 "기근"
BRA_famine_desc:0 "기근은 언제나 브라질에 있어왔지만, 이제 북동부에선 일반적 상황이라 받아들여질 정도로 더 잦아졌습니다."

They were in a far away city that in no way shape or form impacted his home state of Pará. Antônio enjoyed to keep up on the news, as a way for him to know that life existed outside of his small Seminary in Terraverde, besides, his literacy was to be considered a gift in Brazil, and who was he to not use it? But one day brought a different headline, with words like “Blood”, “Fear”, “Terror”, “Death”, and most importantly, “Revolution”. Antônio had a very hard time after that.\n His teachers being taken away, his parents of moderate wealth being stripped of their land rights and forced to work in the mines, he and his class mates having to go through ruthless interrogation after ruthless interrogation, with Antônio having to lie about his social and economic positions to save his life. Life had become very hard for poor Antônio, forced to watch as his life drained away in front away from his eyes. Until one day it was all gone. As he went up to the seminarinal steps one last time, a Red Guard militia blocked his entrance. This was enough for Antônio.\n\n\n With this announcement he broke into a fiery rage, yelling and screaming at the guard with such a hellful passion that the guard simply could not move. When the guards saw what was happening and demanded the mad man to stop with no response, the guard hastily declared him an enemy of the state.\n A gun pointed at his head and with a tear in his eye, Antônio looked at the sky one last time and whispered;"

When João learned of this, he took an oath to himself that he would one day bring this great saving light to Belem, and save not only himself but his fellow countrymen as well. When he learned that there was already a party starting up in Brazil he wasted no time in joining, finding solidarity in his comrades as they dutifully prepared for their own Brazilian revolution. Then disaster struck. The great Bolsheviks, the most successful communists to date, the great liberators of the working class, his idols, had failed. Word soon spread of the disaster, and soon it seemed that the great dream was going to fail, for it seemed that the Revolution had been crushed, and that it was all for naught. But João knew better. Knowing his countrymen, knowing the deplorable conditions they lived in, João refused to give up, he refused to let his countrymen falter. João quickly became known for his rousing speeches and incredible organizing skills, and when Brazil became trapped in yet another constitutional crisis and a nation that seemed headed for civil war, João knew what had to be done, and so did his fellow party members. \n\n\nA great revolution began, this time more successful than João could’ve dreamed. Liberating his countrymen, he felt a dream. And when he and his fellow Party Chairmen came to Rio to formalize the first Revolutional State in the New World he felt Euphoric. But all good things must come to an end. Seeing how his party comrades were becoming more and more revisionist and moderate, refusing to see the problems that Brazil was facing, and turning more and more to soft intellectualism instead of directly helping the Brazilian proletariat. However it wasn’t until he saw his “comrades” having meetings with the North-East Slave owners that he realized that the old Communist Party had lost its goal and vision, and finally realized it was time for it to be put under new management. What he wasn’t expecting was how many of his comrades felt the same way he did. Facing minimal resistance, he simply called a simple hand poll to fire the Chairman of the Party, and another one to put himself on the headmanship. And now? Now it was time to tell the people of Brazil the good news! After taking a moment to realize just how far he had come, João Amazonas smiled at his people and began his speech with a phrase that he had once dreamed of saying…"

mcm.3.desc:0 "Increasingly, it has become apparent to us that the regular military and police forces will not be enough for guaranteeing the security of the people and the stability of the revolution. After several  debates amongst the Central Committee, we have come to the conclusion that a sort of revolutionary reserve, made up of proletarians who have received training in weapons and combat matters, is required for the continued existence of the Commune and the revolution. This organization, of course, will be closely intertwined with the Party, from whom it will take its orders to root out and destroy any counter revolutionaries inside the Commune. The Combat Battalions of the Revolution, as the Party has agreed to name them, will also assist the regular police in keeping law and order in the streets and to target and arrest thieves, whores, vagrants and other sections of the lumpenproletariat who lack class consciousness. We expect the Ministry to closely collaborate with the Party and other concerned institutions in the process of forming this organization."

flo.1.desc:0 "Since the Brazilian Anarchy, various states have emerged and one of them comes from our previous projects in the Polish Colonial Society, where over a hundred thousand poles went to Florianopolis and proclaimed a new Polish Republic, claiming it to be a new colony of Poland that seeks stability and neutrality. However, it has come with a message to us begging for us to protect them and guarantee their independence from the other warlords. What shall we do? The Polish High Command is in extreme favor of this while the Navy is more skeptical. The Political part of Poland, generally the Conservatives and Sanacja supporters are quite supportive of this idea, while Social Democrats are not as interested. What shall be our choice?"
