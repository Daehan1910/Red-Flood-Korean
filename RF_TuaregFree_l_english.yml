#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POLITICS_RAYMOND_COCHE_DESC:0 "Born in 26 January 1904, Raymond Coche, an Aquarian, has always felt a profound connection to the esoteric realms of the World. He began his expeditions across the Sahara in 1935 after endorsements by the French government and he began by trekking and demarcating the Hoggar mountain range. Eventually he was the first one to reach the Garet El Djenoun (a 2330 meter tall mountain) and in late 1935 he decided to abandon his relatively wealthy life with some backing by the French government to live in the Tuareg Free Territory, a land of bandits, slavers, and much more. Now, he sits on the top of the Anarchy, dominating it like a bull, leading it to the Future..."
POLITICS_HAMANI_DIORI_DESC:0 "A young man, Hamani Diori has been one of the few intellectual figures to come out of Niger that believe in making it a nation-state. He sees the Tuareg Free Territory as a tyranny beyond comprehension, something that must be done away with as fast as possible in favor of a western-oriented Republic of Niger that seeks to, despite being filled with corruption, actually function like a country like any other. He is considered very popular in the capital of Niamey but has almost no support elsewhere."
POLITICS_AG_MOHAMMED_DESC:0 "Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen is a Tuareg noble that revolted against French rule in the late 1910s, and after the failure of said rebellion, he famously grabbed one of his horses, stabbed a Frenchman, and dragged him across the desert on horseback to lands unknown. He was nowhere to be found for the next two decades, and his existence became a mystery and a horror story to many colonial governors. Eventually, after the collapse of the French administration in Niger, He was seen returning on foot towards his homeland, found in a home in Agadez. Eventually he became one of the most powerful clan leaders in the Tuareg Free Territory and now leads the land with no leader as it's controller. He is a bandit, a criminal to the French, but a liberator and a hero to the Tuareg slavers. Under him, the Tuareg territory is in an unknown fate..."

#FOCUSES#
tuareg.1.t:0 "우리의 현재"
tuareg.1.desc:0 "Presently, we live in one of the only free areas in the World, where one is able to live as they wish without restriction; a tradition stemming from over a thousand years of nomadic life in the Sahara. However, slavery is extremely common and practiced amongst practically the entire Tuareg population, with children traditionally receiving some slaves to upstart their life after becoming teenagers, and this has resulted in a massive class tension between slaves and nobles. However, there is a third movement of European explorers going across the Sahara and the Niger river in futuristic cars imported from France, creating their own all-European paramilitaries and teaching local Tuaregs about Futurism. What shall be our future is up to the sands of time."
tuareg.1.a:0 "The sands that protect us."
tuareg.2.t:0 "지도자 없는 국가"
tuareg.2.desc:0 "Many of our Hausa plurality peoples have always wanted equality - and their ideals are becoming more and more present - especially in the 'capital' of Niamey, but fortunately for our Territory they have yet to have a capable leader, one who can unify the many clans and tribes of the Hausa and Songhai peoples and cause disorder in the present orderly and harmonious society of the Free Territory."
tuareg.2.a:0 "We have driven out Boubou Hama, we will drive anyone else out!"
tuareg.3.t:0 "해방의 소식"
tuareg.3.desc:0 "It appears we were wrong... \n\n Hamani Diori, a young and charming politician has risen from the banditry of Niamey and learned how to read French by himself, and has begun rallying the Songhai and Hausa peoples against our Tuareg nation! They are unpopular outside of Niamey but using the security mercenaries of Niamey one could take over the whole territory and end our freedom."
tuareg.3.a:0 "Perhaps democracy is a good thing..."
tuareg.4.t:0 "통합자에 대한 소문"
tuareg.4.desc:0 "The Unifier, or Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen, has been a bit of a folk tale for children and adults alike for the last two decades in Niger, one of the great horrors of colonial governance in the area and the susbequent independence of our Territory. So it was suprising to hear that, despite being in the desert for nearly two decades, Kaocen has managed to rise from the sands and has been attempting to reconcile with the various cliques and clans across the Territory in an attempt to unify it."
tuareg.4.a:0 "As long as our freedom is respected..."
tuareg.5.t:0 "Sightings of the Wrath"
tuareg.5.desc:0 "Raymond Coche, a Frenchman, has begun rallying across the desert looking for fellow European explorers and adventurers looking for exciting days to take over our Territory. He has no respect for our traditions and wishes to do away with our supposedly decreipt society and create a new one based on adventure and bravery. The least likely of the candidates to unify the Territory, he has some appeal with some Tuaregs, but otherwise his support is mostly European."
tuareg.5.a:0 "Colonialism but with fast cars?"
tuareg.6.t:0 "Shifting Sands"
tuareg.6.desc:0 "We cannot hold on to our Anarchy forever, as tragic as that is. We have for an impressive amount of time managed to keep the balance between hundreds of clans all across Niger and now it appears this reality is becoming less and less possible. \n\n §RNKaocen, Coche, and Diori all have scheduled to arrive in Agadez by horse or car, and they've decided to place themselves in a standoff; holding swords, they are waiting for the right time to strike.§! \n\n Fate lies in the balance as..."
tuareg.6.a:0 "Kaocen's ancient skills result in Diori beheaded and Coche stabbed in the chest."
tuareg.6.b:0 "Diori dishonors the fight and calls his army from Niamey!"
tuareg.6.c:0 "Coche manages to kill all his enemies!"
tuareg.6.d:0 "A sandstorm arrives and everyone is found dead."
tuareg.7.t:0 "Clans bow"
tuareg.7.desc:0 "Clans across the Territory have begun bowing to Kaocen's rule and those who don't accept are harshly supressed - with time, the freedom that so many Tuaregs cherished has been slowly transformed into a traditionalist chiefdom centralized in a Niamey palace. Of course, the clans that have declared loyalty to Kaocen have received many benefits of autonomy, and therefore much of the country is still out his reach..."
tuareg.7.a:0 "...But he does not mind."
tuareg.8.t:0 "Creation of Bureaucracy"
tuareg.8.desc:0 "The first order of Business for Hamani Diori has been to create the first bureaucracy in Niamey, as the city is surrounded by his security mercenaries and he begins to slowly export them into the rest of the country to secure stability and make the Tuareg-Niger Federation a proper nation-state like their friends in Upper Volta."
tuareg.8.a:0 "A long road is ahead."
tuareg.9.t:0 "Esoteric Rituals"
tuareg.9.desc:0 "Somewhere in the Aïr mountains, Raymond Coche sat atop one of the great mountains and felt the heat across his scarf and skin. He began to speak in tongues with multiple followers, who moaned and cried in a single breath of energy and began drumming with their voices fiercely as they felt their scarves fly across the wind, and Raymond Coche screamed atop the hill: 'My fellow members of the Collective Dream! We are here to become a beacon of Artaud's mind, a beacon that accepts Artaud's supremacy over History and secure Niger as the land of the Future, bowing down to Le Soleil!' He points to the sun, and requests his followers to look at it. They look at the sun, feeling the warmth reaching their face as their eyes close, and they realize they can't handle the single collective spirit of Artaud's projection across the world in his godly existence as his family line came from Greece, resulting in ancestry tracing back to Alexander the Great, Muhammad, and Allah himself as all the ones present in the hill begin laying down on top of one another, feeling their bodies together and moaning as they became a single collective, a small spark in Artaud's mind..."
tuareg.9.a:0 "...that creates a great fire of pleasure."
tuareg.10.t:0 "Realm of Coche"
tuareg.10.desc:0 "After realizing our future in Niger, we must unite with France whilst still maintaining our autonomy. We shall help France at all costs, as we have mobilized our entire population in a full collective."
tuareg.10.a:0 "Send the request to Le Soleil to become a satellite."
tuareg.11.t:0 "Unifying forces Crushed"
tuareg.11.desc:0 "After a great sandstorm distracted all our enemies and they began killing eachother, the Tuareg people and their freedom came out on top and now we are guaranteed to live in freedom for the rest of the century..."
tuareg.11.a:0 "...Or at least we hope."
tuareg.12.t:0 "The death of Freedom"
tuareg.12.desc:0 "Terror has struck Niamey and the whole of the Territory which for so long held to it's freedom as local militias and armies from Nigeira, Upper Volta, and France have begun entering our area as a way to expand their territory - and since we have little to do about it due to the hundreds of clans only paying loyalty to themselves, we are unable to fend off our enemies."
tuareg.12.a:0 "Freedom dies just like that."
tuareg.13.t:0 "The collapse of the Tuareg Territory"
tuareg.13.desc:0 "The Tuareg Free Territory, a pack of roving bandits at the Sahara have begun collapsing entirely into themselves. Many of our generals have requested that we seize part of the territory as to expand Nigeria and the British Empire as a whole."
tuareg.13.a:0 "Set it in motion."
tuareg.14.t:0 "The collapse of the Tuareg Territory"
tuareg.14.desc:0 "The Tuareg Free Territory, a pack of roving bandits at the Sahara have begun collapsing entirely into themselves. Many of our generals have requested that we seize part of the territory as to restore part of the French African territory."
tuareg.14.a:0 "Set it in motion."
tuareg.15.t:0 "The collapse of the Tuareg Territory"
tuareg.15.desc:0 "The Tuaregs, a bunch of bandits and slavers across our border have begun to collapse! Many of our ministers have demanded we come in and help part of these people and seize the capital of Niamey!"
tuareg.15.a:0 "Set it in motion."
tuareg.16.t:0 "유럽인들이 Agadez에서 처형되다!"
tuareg.16.desc:0 "The sands of the lower Sahel in which the Tuareg Free Territory finds itself can be most accurately described by the world, “lawless”. However, when Frenchmen left behind after the collapse of the old French government formed a raiding party to patrol the countryside and attack any poor soul who passed by, the citizens of Agadez decided to take matters into their own hands. Being a territory with no central government, the people of Agadez could not simply report the bandits to the police and be done with it. Instead, concerned citizens formed the Popular Militia, raided an old warehouse full of old French weapons, and set out to track these thugs and bring them to justice. After weeks of pursuit based on nothing but hearsay and vague eyewitness testimony, the bandits were finally caught just after fleeing a raid on a town where most of the adult men had died, and only the elders, women, slaves, and children remained. The militia saw them fleeing with their spoils and chased them down, resulting in a brief shootout before the bandits realized they were outnumbered and outgunned, and surrendered. As the militia tied them up and strapped them to their horses, it was decided that their punishment should be based on the severity of their crimes. The militia rode back towards the village to assess the damage, and they found that not only was no one spared, but that bodies were lined up in two lines: one with elders, and one with slaves, women, and children. It seems the elders were made to watch as the bandits did... unspeakable things. Upon this revelation, the Militia returned them to Agadez and executed them in a makeshift gallows. Due to their actions, the Militia has become well-loved by all the Tuareg people, so much so that the Militia plans on continuing its operations and protecting people from any potential brigands. However, some critics see the issues with giving a small band of armed men power. Only time will tell how the Tuareg will be shaped by these heroes…"
tuareg.16.a:0 "Justice served."
