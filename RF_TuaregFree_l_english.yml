#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POLITICS_RAYMOND_COCHE_DESC:0 "1904년 1월 26일에 태어난 물병자리의 레몽 코슈는 has always felt a profound connection to the esoteric realms of the World. He began his expeditions across the Sahara in 1935 after endorsements by the French government and he began by trekking and demarcating the Hoggar mountain range. Eventually he was the first one to reach the Garet El Djenoun (a 2330 meter tall mountain) and in late 1935 he decided to abandon his relatively wealthy life with some backing by the French government to live in the Tuareg Free Territory, a land of bandits, slavers, and much more. Now, he sits on the top of the Anarchy, dominating it like a bull, leading it to the Future..."
POLITICS_HAMANI_DIORI_DESC:0 "젊은 하마니 디오리는 has been one of the few intellectual figures to come out of Niger that believe in making it a nation-state. He sees the Tuareg Free Territory as a tyranny beyond comprehension, something that must be done away with as fast as possible in favor of a western-oriented Republic of Niger that seeks to, despite being filled with corruption, actually function like a country like any other. He is considered very popular in the capital of Niamey but has almost no support elsewhere."
POLITICS_AG_MOHAMMED_DESC:0 "Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen은 1910년대 후반에 프랑스의 통치에 맞서 반란을 일으켰던 투아레그 귀족으로, 반란이 실패하자 자신의 말 하나를 골라 타곤 프랑스인 하나를 찔러 죽인 후 그 시체를 말에 매달고 미지의 땅으로 사라진 것으로 유명했습니다. He was nowhere to be found for the next two decades, and his existence became a mystery and a horror story to many colonial governors. Eventually, after the collapse of the French administration in Niger, He was seen returning on foot towards his homeland, found in a home in Agadez. 마침내 투아레그 자유령에서 가장 강력한 씨족장들 중 하나가 된 그는 지도자 없는 땅의 통제자로서 서있습니다. 도적이자 프랑스인들에겐 범죄자인 Kaocen이나, 투아레그 노예상들에겐 해방자이자 영웅입니다. Kaocen의 아래서 펼쳐질 투아레그령의 미래는 불확실합니다..."

#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#
#FOCUSES#
tuareg.1.t:0 "우리의 현재"
tuareg.1.desc:0 "Presently, we live in one of the only free areas in the World, where one is able to live as they wish without restriction; a tradition stemming from over a thousand years of nomadic life in the Sahara. However, slavery is extremely common and practiced amongst practically the entire Tuareg population, with children traditionally receiving some slaves to upstart their life after becoming teenagers, and this has resulted in a massive class tension between slaves and nobles. However, there is a third movement of European explorers going across the Sahara and the Niger river in futuristic cars imported from France, creating their own all-European paramilitaries and teaching local Tuaregs about Futurism. What shall be our future is up to the sands of time."
tuareg.1.a:0 "모래가 우릴 지켜주길."
tuareg.2.t:0 "지도자 없는 국가"
tuareg.2.desc:0 "Many of our Hausa plurality peoples have always wanted equality - and their ideals are becoming more and more present - especially in the 'capital' of Niamey, but fortunately for our Territory they have yet to have a capable leader, one who can unify the many clans and tribes of the Hausa and Songhai peoples and cause disorder in the present orderly and harmonious society of the Free Territory."
tuareg.2.a:0 "We have driven out Boubou Hama, we will drive anyone else out!"
tuareg.3.t:0 "해방의 소식"
tuareg.3.desc:0 "아무래도 우리가 틀렸던 것 같습니다... \n\n 하마니 디오리, 니아메의 도적떼 사이에서 일어나 스스로 프랑스어를 배운 젊고 매력적인 이 정치인은, and has begun rallying the Songhai and Hausa peoples against our Tuareg nation! They are unpopular outside of Niamey but using the security mercenaries of Niamey one could take over the whole territory and end our freedom."
tuareg.3.a:0 "어쩌면 민주정이 좋을 수도 있겠어..."
tuareg.4.t:0 "통합자에 대한 소문들"
tuareg.4.desc:0 "통합자, 혹은 Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen이라 불리는 이 사내는 has been a bit of a folk tale for children and adults alike for the last two decades in Niger, one of the great horrors of colonial governance in the area and the susbequent independence of our Territory. So it was suprising to hear that, despite being in the desert for nearly two decades, Kaocen has managed to rise from the sands and has been attempting to reconcile with the various cliques and clans across the Territory in an attempt to unify it."
tuareg.4.a:0 "우리 자유가 존중받는 한이라면..."
tuareg.5.t:0 "격노의 목격"
tuareg.5.desc:0 "프랑스인 레몽 코슈가 has begun rallying across the desert looking for fellow European explorers and adventurers looking for exciting days to take over our Territory. He has no respect for our traditions and wishes to do away with our supposedly decreipt society and create a new one based on adventure and bravery. The least likely of the candidates to unify the Territory, he has some appeal with some Tuaregs, but otherwise his support is mostly European."
tuareg.5.a:0 "빠른 차가 있는 식민주의인가?"
tuareg.6.t:0 "모래 뒤집기"
tuareg.6.desc:0 "We cannot hold on to our Anarchy forever, as tragic as that is. We have for an impressive amount of time managed to keep the balance between hundreds of clans all across Niger and now it appears this reality is becoming less and less possible. \n\n §RNKaocen, Coche, and Diori all have scheduled to arrive in Agadez by horse or car, and they've decided to place themselves in a standoff; holding swords, they are waiting for the right time to strike.§! \n\n Fate lies in the balance as..."
tuareg.6.a:0 "Kaocen's ancient skills result in Diori beheaded and Coche stabbed in the chest."
tuareg.6.b:0 "Diori dishonors the fight and calls his army from Niamey!"
tuareg.6.c:0 "코슈가 모든 적을 죽여버리다!"
tuareg.6.d:0 "모래폭풍이 닥치고 모두가 죽은 채로 발견되다."
tuareg.7.t:0 "씨족들이 절하다"
tuareg.7.desc:0 "Clans across the Territory have begun bowing to Kaocen's rule and those who don't accept are harshly supressed - with time, the freedom that so many Tuaregs cherished has been slowly transformed into a traditionalist chiefdom centralized in a Niamey palace. Of course, the clans that have declared loyalty to Kaocen have received many benefits of autonomy, and therefore much of the country is still out his reach..."
tuareg.7.a:0 "... 하지만 그는 신경 쓰지 않는다."
tuareg.8.t:0 "관료제의 설립"
tuareg.8.desc:0 "The first order of Business for Hamani Diori has been to create the first bureaucracy in Niamey, as the city is surrounded by his security mercenaries and he begins to slowly export them into the rest of the country to secure stability and make the Tuareg-Niger Federation a proper nation-state like their friends in Upper Volta."
tuareg.8.a:0 "기나긴 길이 펼쳐져 있다."
tuareg.9.t:0 "밀교제례"
tuareg.9.desc:0 "Somewhere in the Aïr mountains, Raymond Coche sat atop one of the great mountains and felt the heat across his scarf and skin. He began to speak in tongues with multiple followers, who moaned and cried in a single breath of energy and began drumming with their voices fiercely as they felt their scarves fly across the wind, and Raymond Coche screamed atop the hill: 'My fellow members of the Collective Dream! We are here to become a beacon of Artaud's mind, a beacon that accepts Artaud's supremacy over History and secure Niger as the land of the Future, bowing down to Le Soleil!' He points to the sun, and requests his followers to look at it. They look at the sun, feeling the warmth reaching their face as their eyes close, and they realize they can't handle the single collective spirit of Artaud's projection across the world in his godly existence as his family line came from Greece, resulting in ancestry tracing back to Alexander the Great, Muhammad, and Allah himself as all the ones present in the hill begin laying down on top of one another, feeling their bodies together and moaning as they became a single collective, a small spark in Artaud's mind..."
tuareg.9.a:0 "...that creates a great fire of pleasure."
tuareg.10.t:0 "코슈의 영역"
tuareg.10.desc:0 "니제르에서의 우리의 미래를 깨달았으니, 우리는 우리 자치권을 보존하면서 프랑스와 단결해야 합니다. 우리의 전 인구를 총체적 집합체로 동원하듯, 모든 대가를 치러서라도 프랑스를 도울 것입니다."

tuareg.11.desc:0 "After a great sandstorm distracted all our enemies and they began killing eachother, the Tuareg people and their freedom came out on top and now we are guaranteed to live in freedom for the rest of the century..."
tuareg.11.a:0 "... 적어도 그러길 바라지."
tuareg.12.t:0 "자유의 죽음"
tuareg.12.desc:0 "Terror has struck Niamey and the whole of the Territory which for so long held to it's freedom as local militias and armies from Nigeira, Upper Volta, and France have begun entering our area as a way to expand their territory - and since we have little to do about it due to the hundreds of clans only paying loyalty to themselves, we are unable to fend off our enemies."
tuareg.12.a:0 "자유는 그렇게 죽었다."
tuareg.13.t:0 "투아레그령의 붕괴"
tuareg.13.desc:0 "The Tuareg Free Territory, a pack of roving bandits at the Sahara have begun collapsing entirely into themselves. Many of our generals have requested that we seize part of the territory as to expand Nigeria and the British Empire as a whole."
tuareg.13.a:0 "Set it in motion."
tuareg.14.t:0 "투아레그령의 붕괴"
tuareg.14.desc:0 "The Tuareg Free Territory, a pack of roving bandits at the Sahara have begun collapsing entirely into themselves. Many of our generals have requested that we seize part of the territory as to restore part of the French African territory."

tuareg.15.t:0 "투아레그령의 붕괴"
tuareg.15.desc:0 "우리 국경 너머에 있던 도적떼이자 노예상들인 투아레그들이 붕괴하기 시작했습니다! 많은 우리 각료들이 우리가 끼어들어 저들을 도와 수도 니아메를 차지해야 한다 주장하고 있습니다!"
tuareg.15.a:0 "시작하지."
tuareg.16.t:0 "유럽인들이 Agadez에서 처형되다!"
tuareg.16.desc:0 "The sands of the lower Sahel in which the Tuareg Free Territory finds itself can be most accurately described by the world, “lawless”. However, when Frenchmen left behind after the collapse of the old French government formed a raiding party to patrol the countryside and attack any poor soul who passed by, the citizens of Agadez decided to take matters into their own hands. Being a territory with no central government, the people of Agadez could not simply report the bandits to the police and be done with it. Instead, concerned citizens formed the Popular Militia, raided an old warehouse full of old French weapons, and set out to track these thugs and bring them to justice. After weeks of pursuit based on nothing but hearsay and vague eyewitness testimony, the bandits were finally caught just after fleeing a raid on a town where most of the adult men had died, and only the elders, women, slaves, and children remained. The militia saw them fleeing with their spoils and chased them down, resulting in a brief shootout before the bandits realized they were outnumbered and outgunned, and surrendered. As the militia tied them up and strapped them to their horses, it was decided that their punishment should be based on the severity of their crimes. The militia rode back towards the village to assess the damage, and they found that not only was no one spared, but that bodies were lined up in two lines: one with elders, and one with slaves, women, and children. It seems the elders were made to watch as the bandits did... unspeakable things. Upon this revelation, the Militia returned them to Agadez and executed them in a makeshift gallows. Due to their actions, the Militia has become well-loved by all the Tuareg people, so much so that the Militia plans on continuing its operations and protecting people from any potential brigands. However, some critics see the issues with giving a small band of armed men power. Only time will tell how the Tuareg will be shaped by these heroes…"
tuareg.16.a:0 "Justice served."
