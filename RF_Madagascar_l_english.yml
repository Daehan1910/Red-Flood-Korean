POLITICS_RANAVALONA_III_DESC:0 "Born July 30 1861, the reign of Queen Ranavalona III is perhaps one of the most unusual in recorded history, for which sovereign could claim to fight valiantly against encroaching foreign influence, be gracious upon losing the divine mandate, then returning triumphantly to reinstate it and free her people from foreign chains? \n Yet things are unfortunately never so simple, born into a time where the sovereign of the Kingdom of Madagascar had become largely a ceremonial figure. Ironically this happened, unlike in western countries, not because of the machinations of liberals or peasants but a coup by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony with support of the army and nobles in 1863. Killing the incumbent Radama II (rumors of the King’s survival in obscurity remain to this day however) and replacing the absolute authority of the sovereign with power being 'shared' with the Prime Minister, recruited from the nobility. Of course the subsequent monarchs largely then fell under the thumb of the Prime Minister. This was the lot of Ranavalona III too, with the bulk of her duties being to deliver pre written speeches, attending ceremonies and overseeing meetings. This ended abruptly in 1897 with the french who had been bickering with british for long whose domain the island should be, annexing the island proper, ending the monarchy and forcing her into exile in Algiers and under the watchful eyes of the French. Here she would have lived out the rest of the days as a high society socialite and occasional tourist to France, if fate didn't have the devastation of the Great War in store. Suddenly the great colonial empire of the french was thrown into turmoil, their grasp slipping as internal and economic instability took them. And it was in this turmoil that to Ranavalona’s villa in the midst of the night a host of malagasy nobles came. Proclaiming their undying loyalty after overwhelming her french retainers, after over two decades she finally saw her beloved homeland again. With the French signing a treaty to concede most of the island except the port of Diego-Suarez, in a grand parade through the nation tens of thousands of her people welcomed their sovereign back, alas whilst the crown she now wears is a new one the system that contains her is not. With her being the same figurehead she was since her youth. Worse yet, Ranavalona is now an old woman long battling with an embolism that slowly but surely des, with no heir apparent as the only one sporting a rightful claim, Marie-Louise, choosing to forego her divine right in favor of the palors and madness of the reborn French State. With the aristocracy long plotting to take even what little power she still has left may see this as the perfect time to strike. In the end Ranavalona could only realize that the gracious given to her by fate was in the end only borrowed time and despite her best efforts she may truly be the last of the Malagasy monarchs..."
POLITICS_DIDELOT_DESC:0 "Born December 21 1902, Francis Didelot was always a man of two worlds. Born on malagasy soil a descendant to the great Edgar Allen Poe into the islands sizeable french enclave, Didelot spend much of his youth travelling across the world due to his father's position as a colonial governor. Yet despite his distant travels, he always felt a special connection to both the land where he was born and the land of his parents. Following his great ancestors footsteps, he cast away his first existence as a lawyer to pursue a career in writing. Covering a wide range of subjects from historical papers about the theater to writing play for it himself, to writing texts for radio and the burgeoning media of TV. However in 1931 he was uprooted, Artaud’s revolution forever tainting the memory and beauty of his beloved second homeland. Cast adrift he returned to his first homeland a broken man. Yet the mistress of fate is truly capricious, and he soon found himself surrounded by hundreds of his countrymen who had befallen the same fate. Vowing to at least preserve some of France’s greatness, they worked and lobbied unendingly for Madagascar to finally the shackles of monarchism and become a Republic, and fate would award him once again: the death of queen Ranavalona III granted him the perfect opening to strike. Now Didelot is the President of one of the few african countries sporting a truly functioning democracy, alas even if France’s soul may be forever charred by Artaud’s madness perhaps he can preserve some of its soul on this distant island..."
POLITICS_REGENCY_COUNCIL_MADAGASCAR_DESC:0 "Thanks to the chaos and unrest that followed the gridlock of the Great War and the subsequent fires of revolution, monarchies have become quite the rare sight on the world stage, with absolute ones more so the pariah. The Kingdom of Madagascar has before they came under foreign boot and after they threw it off again been one of those now lone pariahs. Only this it is only on the surface, for since 'Aristocratic Revolution' of 1863, the regicide of King Radama II by the Prime Minister, sparked by the King’s choice to legalize the practice of dueling, power has mainly rested with the latter as well of course with the caste of aristocrats from whom the Prime Minister was recruited. In a cruel twist of fate this order was yet destroyed by the very men the aristocracy had invited so openly into their lands: the french, annexing the kingdom proper left the aristocrats merely as affluent landlords without much political say. With the fires of the Great War their time to strike came less than two decades later: with the french abandoning most of the islands, the aristocrats swiftly reinstated the system they had dominated. Alas even with queen Ranavalona III fully cooperating, many of the nobility saw the monarchy itself as a distant relic that only held the country back. With the queen leaving no heir apparent the perfect time to strike came: besting all other pretenders to control over the country and declaring an eternal regency, quietly and solemnly the Malagasy Monarchy has died..."
POLITICS_RALAIMONGO_DESC:0 "Born October 4 1884 in the region of Antoebe, born to a pastor in one of the many missions of Madagascar, Ralaimongo’s relationship with his country was of all those that reached for lordship over it during the chaos following queen Ranavalona III’s death the most difficult.For despite being born to a free man, the majority of his childhood he spent as a slave. Kidnapped at age seven along with most of his family, he was sold alone to a man from the region of Bara. Spending seven years as property, his salvation came from a most unexpected benefactor: the french.Whilst they cast his country 1897 in shackles, for Ralaimongo and tens of thousands this meant freedom as they brought with them the end of slavery.Returning to his family in 1898, retaining a deep seated gratitude to the french and an equally deep seated disgust for the old regime.Going on to become a teacher, he went on to repay some of the debt he felt he owned to France by manning the trenches for them during the Great War.Staying in Paris for some years after he immersed himself in intellectual circles, and even meeting the man that would one day take on the name of Ho Chi Minh.Organizing and agitating for a freer and more equal Madagascar since his return in 1924, Ralaimongo became a persistent thorn in the colonial administration and later the newly reborn kingdom’s sides.Now Ralaimongo stands at the helm of the first african country to embrace socialism: promising a truly free and democratic society for all those born behind and destroying the elites that shipped him and tens of thousand others as cattle, a new red dawn rises..."
POLITICS_RABEARIVELO_DESC:0 "Born March 4 1901, the name of Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo is in the minds of many, especially the francophone world often the first name that comes to mind upon hearing the word 'Madagascar'. Yet despite receiving the gift of immortality at such a young age and having admirers and believers all across the globe, the man still lives in much the same poverty he has lived in since the french seized his family’s wealth upon annexing the island.For underneath the image of a literary genius lies a deeply troubled man, for that which made him great is also his curse. His mind sparking interest in not only french literature but french and malagasy poetry caused him to immerse himself in that world from an early age, publishing his first poem at age fourteen.Alas this love also became a burden, for his love did not just extend to the literary realm alone but the movements of culture and politics, particularly surrealism and futurism. The latter he became perhaps inadvertently movements head of on his island as many young intellectuals flocked to him upon him expressing sympathy for the movement. Causing him to be ostracized by much of the countries establishment despite his international fame, becoming the target of frequent harassment and contempt after Ranavalona III’s restoration.Worse yet, in 1933 his only three year old daughter died due to illness. This caused him to dip even deeper into the vices he had already abused before: philandering, womanizing and his ever growing opium addiction.Multiple times he contemplated suicide over the years, till under the midday sun as he was already balancing a capsule filled with cyanide between his fingertips, suddenly a host of his followers came to his house. Frantically bringing him the news that Queen Ranavalona had died and the streets were already filled with blood, in a haze he followed his followers onto the streets, onwards onto the capital, still contemplating what to do he was suddenly hit with a jolt of clarity: he had not received sacred visions like Artaud did but perhaps because of his flaws he was destined to save his land and people.Taking the lead of the mass of his fellow futurists he led a valiant charge against the capital, vanquishing all that would dare stand in their way and proclaiming a new order, one of most delicate beauty and national rebirth.And while shunned by the mortal realm, as he and his followers unravel the border behind reality and that beyond, it is perhaps on the mystic shores of Lemuria that he will finally find peace..."
