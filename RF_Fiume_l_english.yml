But now, we need to act quickly if we are to develop in today's world and with D'Annunzio's health slowly waning, it means that other factions can slowly take power and place their approaches on the situation instead of D'Annunzio's neutral attitude. Marinetti suggests massive centrally directed labor force paid in food and housing, Shimoi believes that factory buy-ups and state acquisition of industry is a nescessity, and Keller believes that the best course of action is to ensure that the local syndicates have more power, in order to encourage local production, even at the expense of international trade."

You were visionary many decades ago, being the first troops of your kind, using only light equipment and subsequently entering trenches without the fear of death - They were also said to be the most feared corps by opposing armies. The task of Arditi units was not to clear the way for regular infantry to attack enemy lines, but to completely overrun enemy positions. The most daring volunteers were chosen, particularly those who were not bothered by loud incoming artillery fire close by. The men also studied fencing and were masters of hand-to-hand combat. Once ready, they were sent to the front armed with light assault weapons such as carbines, pistols, daggers and hand grenades. Many did not carry rifles and carbines because they would be cumbersome to fire in the confined spaces of a trench. The Arditi approached enemy trenches while they were being shelled by Italian artillery. Just as the barrage was lifted they would jump inside the trench while the enemy was huddling down, and use their daggers at close quarters to suppress enemy resistance. These primitive tactics were surprisingly effective. The Arditi stood in front of death with a pride never seen in Europe. Your motto was \"O La Vittoria, O Tutti Accopati\", and it still rings true today. Fortunately, we must adapt to the Future, and become once more the pioneers of the World, and therefore, we must choose what to do. How shall we improve our great and honorable Arditi?

They race like a whirlwind, demolishing everything in their path, easily crushing barricades, jumping over intersections like a pack of street thugs. \nThe futuristic army has entered Rome and is greeted by the smoke of fires, the sounds of distant shots, the silent streets, and the colorful drawings on the walls. Although the Testaccio arose long before the first vehicles arrived, the futurists still had to make their way through the center with blood. Here the remnants of the besieged Italian troops fought with the bravery of the doomed. It was a wonderful, almost magical experience, but, nevertheless, the king was still able to escape. He was lucky, but you can`t say so about the whole royal district, which was turned into ruins. \nThe same fate awaits the Vatican - by the evening, fourteen batteries of beautiful, singing howitzers will begin the methodical destruction of St. Peter's Basilica and all surrounding areas.

The Italian army is caught unawares - no amount of anti-aircraft weapons can stop such a huge shoal of celestial hunters, no land army can fight against an enemy that appears everywhere at the same time. With Arditic courage, the soldiers of Fiume storm the positions, chase, destroy and surround, and strike aircrafts hover over their heads like ravens, spreading panic, and taking away any opportunity to organize a defense. The Kingdom of Italy is no more - there is only Fiume everywhere, in flags and faces, on the radio and the walls of rebellious neighborhoods. The king flees, and his palace becomes the property of the newly organized communes and corporations of Rome, a true phalanster for all.

The star is met by her old cavalier, Il Vata himself. All this causes a wave of patriotic feelings, and unprecedented excitement in the city - even those who are not interested in music, want to see \"our Louise\" again. The languid carnival of Fiume erupts as if someone had thrown dynamite into an ammunition depot. \nD’Annunzio could not leave the goddess of Music without a suitable gift, and immediately upon arrival, the pianist received an extraordinary present - a piano made entirely of mother-of-pearl and ivory, as pure and beautiful as Musa di Fiume. \nBaccara will stay in the city for a month, and it will be a magical month - both for residents and for many journalists who are always looking for new scandalous material for their foreign tabloids."

After all, it's worth quite a lot of money, and he didn't spend it so that someone would spit or cough on his jacket now!\nTherefore, he had no idea what he would be dealing with when the pianist's miniature hands touched the piano keys and a wave of music swept through the hall.\nHe had never heard of such a thing. Philippe participates in the choir of their corporation (as well as almost everyone), but it was a completely different, hitherto unseen feeling. It was as if some nymph of music had invisibly hugged his shoulders and was whispering something softly in his ear. Philippe felt a lump in his throat, a small sun that was rising, rising, and suddenly tears came out of his eyes, and he had difficulty breathing. It's such a new feeling that he coughs - but no one pays attention to it, everyone is too absorbed in the magic of sound.\nSomeone hands him a handkerchief, and he smiles gratefully at the old-fashioned gentleman with the glasses. But the performance goes naturally, and now the scene is changing. Philippe did not notice when it happened, but now in the light of music flocks of kinetic ballerinas dancing,  and men and women in antique togas and dresses singing their arias. He does not remember the name of this play or opera - he lost the program - but listens carefully as if his life depends on it. The music goes so well with all this. In turn, the nymph smiles at him, and leads on…\nHere, when the city is saved from enemies, the piano plays joyfully and impressively, here, when the girl-heroine finds the body of her brother in hostile attire, it plays with sad solemnity.\nHere, strict grandfather-king denies her the right to bury her brother, and the musical accompaniment begins to cut like glass cut the heart.\nHere, she steals brother`s body at night, and Philippe feels anxious, as if he is there himself, in the dim light of the stage, dancing to the music.\nHere, she is caught - and the stern king passes his sentence, and with it reaches the culmination of the play…\nAnd the listeners can't stand it.\n-Hey, an old stump, leaves her alone!  -someone shouts and others support him with laughter, shouts, and relieved applause.\nEveryone seems to have forgotten that they are watching the play.\nThe old king did not raise an eyebrow but waved to his hoplites, who dive into the crowd to bring the daredevils to the stage.\nOf course, neither Philippe nor several thousand spectators are intimidated by this. With a thunderous roar, a human wave splashes onto the stage and spins everything - the actors, themselves, laughter, screaming, Philippe with a chair in his hands and an old-fashioned gentleman with the glasses, piano, and Louise, hoplites and ballerinas, dance and sound - all are becoming one huge, futuristic whirlwind of harmony. A thousand planets dancing around one piano like a parade of stars ... \nThey will carry Baccara in their arms all the way to the hotel."

Extravagant and colorful as always - a banana-burning jacket, chic checkered trousers - he nevertheless still looks like just another shadow against the solemn twilight landscape of Fiume, dotted with carnival lights, distant songs, and strings of lanterns in the streets below.\nIn the dim light of a kerosene lamp, he resembles a metal statue that froze at the edge of the tower, examining his territories from a height. And only the light of a cigarette betrays a living person in this statue.\nThe father of Futurism watches the Palace of Music and silently marvels at its beauty. Behind the deceptive classic contours hides a truly futuristic spirit - Giacomo tried his best by painting the interior. Here and there the filling leaks out, creating a strange, strange effect that shocks passeisti so much. \"It's violence against art, how can…\"\n“It is possible, and it will be! The muse of culture needs a good beating! We will saddle it, and we will race into the future with the power of true futuristic machismo and rudeness!\"\nSomewhere far away, in the port, the lights flicker and the sounds of orchestras are heard - Fiume accompanies Louise Baccara in her departure. The famous pianist again leaves her magical prince, who is increasingly locked in the enchanting world of his palace, among roses, banners, and chocolate.\nMarinetti put out his cigarette.\nHe felt a little sorry for Gabriele, who was too weak, too soft during the romantic, sublime lying on the bed of Fiuman peace… but he approved of both his choice of music and his choice of women. For all her \"conservatism\", this pianist is endowed with a truly futuristic spirit.\nAnd her departure should be marked by a real futuristic spectacle.\n-Is everything ready, Umberto?\nUmberto Boccioni, biting a cigarette and holding a bulky phone on his lap, nodded.\n-Yes, we are ready. Agello has already taken off.\n-Good.\nAt that very moment, the Palace of Music was ignited by hundreds of searchlights, a bright mechanical construct, a motor the size of a city. Light shimmers on its surface as if it were not a simple building, but a structure made of pure diamonds.\nHigh above the luxurious roof, a colored plane hovers in the air, it glows like a lantern, and then almost clings to the roof, then takes off high under the clouds. The child of the future, ready to leap forward, he burns the desire to act, like the young spirit of the futurists, bound by a spectacle of beauty - charming, but frozen, like the Palace.\n-Three, two, one… Let's go!\nWith a thunderous roar, the Palace of Music shudders, as if from a heartbeat, and begins to slowly settle, collapsing as if in itself. Another explosion - and it turns into a bright ball of fire, splutters flames into the sky, engulfs a small and defenseless plane - just to make the machine fly out of hell a second later, as bright and shiny as before. Now all the searchlights are aimed at the sky, at the plane, which leaves behind the smoky ruins, and accelerates into the night sky…"

Until the workers arrived, it was possible to relax a little - it is unlikely that anyone will try to steal the suitcases of the Muse Fiume in the port, especially when he is nearby.\nThe liners in general, and Conte Verde in particular, have always fascinated Delfino with their machine perfection and grace. This is the most perfect of all types of ships, more complex even than the military cruisers, but much, much more beautiful. Each ship he always associated with one of the women he met once on the way of life. This liner was clearly like Bianca from Trieste - small and calm, but so sweet and with such beautiful green eyes. Maybe someday, when the Commander conquers Italy, he will return to Bianca and will design ocean liners - large, white, multi-tube… But for now - \"Hello, weapons!\"\nA rough scream, clearly in his direction, brings young Ardito from the dreamy half-sleep. A suspicious group of people, several strong guys in plainclothes and a man in carabinieri uniforms, shouting something and quickly approached.\nJust in case, Delfino hid an arditi blade in his sleeve. It is a pity that Paolo is not around ...\nThe carabinieri limped a little, as if he had once been kissed by the war, but struck the ardito with a rage unbelievable for such height. He waved his folder frantically and gestured rudely.\n-Hey you, kid! Yes, you, give me here the documents for the cargo! What do you say there? It was already been examined? But my documents - another round of dancing with a folder - says no! I have an order from the prefect! Give me the documents here, or I'll requisition the contraband! What? I don't care whose is those luggage, it is smuggling, and I take away everything. You don't have documents? No need to call anyone, I already understood everything! Guys, we requisition it all! Hey, step back, ki…\nDelfino grabbed the carabiner's hand, stopping this ballet of papers.\n-Nobody will take anything. The financial guard will come and judge us!\nThe carabiner blushed, pulling his hand out of his grip.\n-Oh, you son of a bitch! Guys, take-\nThe officer's eyes stared blankly at the hilt of the blade, which so suddenly stuck out his chest the next moment. With the same disbelieving look, he collapsed back like a puppet with trimmed strings.\nThe young men froze, clearly not expecting such a development, and Delfino raised his hand cautiously. Adrenaline pounded in his blood like steel hammers.\n-Don`t interfe...\nBefore he could finish, the loud bah-bah-bah sounded, and the steel painter casually slapped three red spots on Delfino's uniform. Ardito turned pale and fell on the cold pavement. He still had time to hear the stamping of feet, the screams, and sounds of the growing disturbance, before the darkness absorbed his sensations."

This time, some people justified the use of violence against officials who appeared to have exceeded their authority, while others condemned the psychopathic and inadequate nature of the Fiumans. But what was a distant newspaper chatter for most Italians was a pressing headache for the Minister, a clock running here and now. The Venetian events were a real clusterfuck of misunderstandings and unspoken, and the Minister once again reflected on the fact that the executive branch needs a total overhaul. The erroneously sent order was confusing and misunderstood - so the justification of the prefect sounded. Of course, this did not explain where the luggage, which according to the police report, she seized during the incident, went. The prefect only shrugged, the only thing he could do was to shrug and promise compensation. This oakhead will probably not stay in position long…\nBut that's not the end of the problem. The Fiuman adventurer spoke, and his mouth was Enrico Corradini. The respectable writer managed to distance himself from extremists in time of severe years of public unrest but maintained friendly personal ties with D’Annunzio. This proved especially invaluable in the absence of formal diplomacy between the two states.\nThat is why this morning Corradini bring a letter from the Commandante to the Government of the Kingdom of Italy, demanding to unconditionally admit Italy's guilt in what happened, to conduct an open investigation, to punish the entire city administration of Venice, and to pay compensation to the victims from Fiuman side.\nThe proposal has provoked heated debate among the government, with conservatives strongly opposed - we cannot set a precedent for powerlessness before D’Annunzio, while liberals are still inclined to accept demands to defuse tensions."

fiume.19.desc:0 "“Citizens! Ironheads of Fiume! Today we have received terrible news, and it fills my heart with grief and my eyes with tears. Our brave falcons, our life-loving young heroes became victims. Victims of a cemented, sleepy, rotten, rusty vehicle. This vehicle is called the Kingdom of Italy. Our beloved homeland, to which we so longed to return, continues to suffer under the oppression of capitalism, corruption, and demagoguery. Now this abomination has killed our children, our martyrs of the Spirit.\nThis is not just a crime. It's not just murder. It is an act of aggression, an act of open and unbridled aggression. This is another crime in a series of crimes, another step in this Crusade against Beauty, against all the Light and Pure in this world. This march will continue as long as Fiume exists, as long as it carries its torch through the darkness, as long as it heralds the beginning of the New World.\nDo you hear that sound?\"\n*distant noise of aircraft propellers*\n“This is how angels cry. On this day, everyone is in sorrow - even our magnificent nature is painfully affected by this blow. Do you feel this pain, citizens? Do you feel this anger, citizens?\n*chorus of distant voices*\n\"And I feel it too. Have I not been with you all these years, in sorrow and joy? Was I not your heart and soul?\"*chorus of approving voices*\n\"I promise you that this sacrifice will not be in vain. Our children will stand next to us on this fiery path to the future, on the path that will lead us to victory, on the path that will lead us to the Homeland as heroes, on the path that will lead us to the Divinely Beautiful World of the Future!\nThen, in the blazing rays of the Mediterranean sun, in the turquoise breeze of the Adriatic, we will destroy the rusty Machine of Italy. We will replace it with a new one. With a new one - aesthetic, sacred, and full of deep meaning! Are you ready to go with me into this future? Are you ready to put everything on this altar of total self-immolation with me? Are you ready? Are you ready?!\"\nYES\nYES\nYES..."

fiume.20.desc:0 "Planes cut the turquoise and jade of the sky like a diamond knife. There are five of them - the time-worn battle falcons of the Great War, the swift-footed achilleses of this Iliad. Each of them is as unique as their pilot. Each of them is an expression of the free spirit of freedom, the impulse of creativity - like their pilots. Pirate philosophers, poets-yogis, artists-scientists, and above all, free, completely free people. Guido Keller would not gather others in his team.\nThe legendary action secretary, the owner of a chic mustache and Arditic hair, sat in the lead plane, his favorite \"Ace of Hearts\", the beautiful Nieuport, painted in all possible shades of orange, red and yellow, as if it were not an airplane, but an angular piece of sun with the propeller. How beautiful he is, this plane, and how beautiful they all are, his young heroes!\nFrowning from the high, hot sun, Keller finished his coffee carefully and set the cup down on the makeshift personal sideboard. Then he adjusted his snow-white scarf, looked around at his wards and shouted at the radio at the top of his voice - the wind drowns out the words \"Hey, Ulfo, gain height, you're lagging! Theodata, turn north 300 degrees and sunset! Giovanni, read us poems!\"\nGiovanni Comisso, a cheerful and ever-smiling lover of peaches and sailboats, sang as loud as he could, filling the air with his verses, inspiring unexpected feelings and new, interesting emotions. They sail the blue sea of ​​heaven, listening about the blue clear waters of the Adriatic, and dive between the clouds like a yacht between the islands of Dalmatia.\nBelow, on the ground, the green squares of meadows and strips of the forest changed into a chaotic chessboard of suburbs, as the flying chaos came closer to its goal - to the glorious city of Rome. They are waiting for the mission entrusted to them by the Poet-Prophet.\nThen, before departure, the Aviator inspected his team again. They are all the celestial and spiritual elite of Fiume, which despises the petty conventions of bourgeois society even more than other citizens. One day they will lead Fiume forward like another high-speed plane, but for now, they are flying, dressed only in their impudence and an intense layer of body-paintings.\nCloser to the city, their formation disintegrates for a moment, unable to withstand emotions, and a uniform commotion begins, the nightmare of any flight instructor, when planes decorated with lotus and roses behave like foals in new meadows - playfully chasing each other and almost crashing in themselves.\nBut everything changes when Guido blows into his hunting horn, giving a signal to the colorful machines to stand in line and prepare for the attack.\nWhere did all the mischief disappear? One by one, the planes dive down, like colored shadows descending to the level of the houses and cathedrals of the Eternal City, and then fall their cargo on the heads of the crowd that poured on the streets of the city.\nSeveral tons of flowers fell on the heads of the stunned Romans. This event will flood the newspapers for the week.\nWithout encountering resistance, the fighters enter another circle, this time over poor areas, where people look at the sky with fear and disbelief, only to get a pack of chocolate on their heads. Not everyone is so lucky - there is not enough chocolate, although they have drained all of D’Annunzio’s supplies (Gabriele won’t mind). Nevertheless, those who have seen this surreal picture of candies tied up by red ribbons falling from the sky certainly will have something to discuss at home.\nThe final round, this time over the parliament building. Keller's plane descends quietly and smoothly, almost landing with all its weight on the expensive slate. One moment, and where he had just been, a donkey stared at the world from the roof with its sad black eyes, as he flew from Fiume to Rome in an action secretary plane.\nLeaving behind the commotion, chaos, and general confusion, Fiuman yogis return home singing…"

Italy sent its late birds to intercept.\nOf course, none of them is equal to the pilots of YOGA society, but their planes are newer, and they are clearly more numerous.\n\"Guido\" - noise on the radio, - \"It's time for us to turn east if we want to break away from them. Let's jump over Rimini. We'll have to press, but-\"\n\"No\" Keller said angrily, \"We don't have enough fuel, so we're flying straight. We fly through these royal birds.\"\nAnother horn of a hunting horn:\n-Siblings, get ready to feel the razor-acute thrill of adrenaline in the blood because we are moving towards ultimate action. Let us take down these forty from the noble face of heaven!\nThis mini-speech elicited a chorus of applause, and one by one, the old MAS and Newport gathered in attacking formations, preparing to fall on their opponents like a vulture for prey.\nTwo flocks quickly approach, but no one shoots - the Fiumans save ammunition and the Italians… Are they afraid?\nWhat? Why do they return?\n-How dare you run away from an honest duel! - Now Keller is really angry.\nBut his anger changes to surprise when a familiar voice is heard on the radio.\n\"Keller? You?\"\n\"Mario Gordesco? Where are you running to, you, old son of a bitch, I owe you for Lake Garda.\"\n\"We will settle scores in Fiume. We did not come to attack you, Guido, we are flying with you! Tell your people not to shoot, I don't want us to set each other on fire.\"\nKeller shouted furiously on the radio, ordering to postpone the attack:\n\"It's ours, hang up, they're flying with us!\"\nNow the two flocks mixed into a colorful cluster of aircraft and no less colorful pilots.\n\"Decided to the desert, Mario?\"\n\"I'm just changing employers, Guido - the king's oath doesn't go anywhere. Do you still accept the heaven folks there in Fiume?\"\nKeller laughed.\n\"Only with your planes, Mario, only with your own!\"\n\"Well, then we're on the right track, guys.\"\n\"On the burning path to the future\"\n\"Exactly, Lieutenant.\" "

It is almost impossible to trace something in this chaos.\nRenzo Coletti fought bravely, but it seems to him it's over. He lost his squadron, wherever he looked he saw only green fuselages and royal emblems. Two CR.32 grabbed his tail with machine guns and gradually shoot the skin. If they get to the benzine tank, Renzo will become a burning bullet.\nKeller is somewhere far away, and from the clippings on the radio, it seems that the squadron is not in the best condition.\nMaybe he can still change something. Maybe he can still save someone ...\nThe coordinated attack of the Italian fighters failed when one kellerista, pilot of already almost burning MAS in a spiral black and white camouflage, turned sharply into the thick of his foes. The pilots had to disperse, turn around their CR.32, so as to finally run like a flock on this stubborn leftover and drive it away.\nBut the spiral plane was not going to run away, tenaciously withstanding all the hits, losing parts and already actually falling apart. In the end, it all ended quickly - like a bright fiery apple, he rammed the fighter of Major Trevorio and collapsed with him to his heavenly grave."
