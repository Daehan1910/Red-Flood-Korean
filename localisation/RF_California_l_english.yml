CAL.1.desc:0 "캘리포니아에 오신 것을 환영합니다.  여러분이 어떻게 이곳에 도착했는지와 상관없이, 미국은 이미 무너졌습니다. 우리가 왔던 바다에서 우리가 도착한 빛나는 바다까지, 우리의 공정한 국가 외에는 더 이상 중요하지 않습니다. 제임스타운의 후예들은 우리는 마침내 죽음이라는, 미국이란 실험의 논리적 결론에 도달했습니다. \n\n 그리하여, 빈곤 속에 부스러기나 모으며 살아가야 할지라도 우리는 조각들을 모아 삶을 이어 나가야 합니다. 거리에선 사람들이 죽어가고 리버사이드 평의회는 형편없이 배분된 자원들을 갖고서 질서를 유지하고자 최선을 다하고 있는 데다 전반적으로 혼돈이 퍼지고 있습니다. 하지만 미국이라는 실험에서 파생된 이 새로운 실험에는 애국적 심원도 있습니다. 어쩌면 여기선 좋은 결과가 있을지도 모르죠."

CAL.2.title:0 "두려움에 떨 준비를 하라!"
CAL.2.desc:0 "보딘은 자신의 아파트에서 괴물의 세계가 손짓하는 가운데 석양이 캘리포니아의 선량한 사람들을 집어삼키는 것을 바라보았습니다. 빛이 서서히 사라지자 그는 이미 악마와 불경한 존재가 공기 중에 현현하는 것을 느낄 수 있었습니다. 온 세상에 악령, 좀비, 유령, 외계인, 그리고 인간들의 결점까지 악의 기운이 해가 지고 나자 퍼져나가고 있었습니다. 그는 몇 시간 동안 세상이 암흑으로 변하는 것을 창밖으로 바라보았습니다. 그 후 그는 세상과 단절하고 환상의 영역으로 행복하게 들어가려고 했지만, 문제는 계속 그를 갉아먹었고 신이 태양을 다시 보낼 때까지 초자연적인 영역에 머물러야만 했습니다. 하지만 혼자서 이 싸움을 하는 것은 무의미하다고 생각한 그는 어둠 속에서 조금이나마 위안을 얻기 위해 평소 즐겨보던 방송국 중 하나인 KCW를 틀었습니다. 하지만 방송 내용은 어둠이 그의 제한된 육체적 시력보다 훨씬 더 깊숙이 침투해 있다는 것을 보여주었습니다. 동부의 상황이 급격히 악화되고 있으며 내전이 임박했다는 공포스러운 이야기가 방송에 나왔습니다. '당연히' 그는 혼자 조용히 중얼거렸습니다. '동쪽에는 어둠이 더 일찍 오는구나'. 그 발표는 그를 두려움에 휩싸이게 했지만, 한편으로는 예상하지 못했던 또 다른 희망으로 가득 차게 했습니다. 그는 어둠이 언젠가는 끝날 것이라는 것을 알고 있었지만... 그 시기가 앞당겨질 수 있다면 세상에 더 좋지 않을까요? 사람들은 그것을 '계몽'이라고 불렀습니다, 횃불이라고 말이지요... 그렇죠! 그는 깨달은 즉시 겁에 질린 교환원에게 전화를 걸었고, 마침내 영원의 목표가 다가온다는 설렘으로 그는 물었습니다;"

CAL.3.title:0 "올슨의 몽상"
CAL.3.desc:0 "올슨은 그 생각을 견디기 힘들었습니다. 동부는 끝났다는 것을 그는 알고 있었습니다. 아나키스트들은 자신들이 하고자 하는 짓을 다했고, 군대는 반란을 일으켰으며, 상황은 사실상 끝났다는 걸 말입니다. 하지만 오늘 그가 해야 할 일은 그게 아니었습니다. 오늘 그는 선거 운동을 위해 다른 회의에 참석해야 했습니다. 무슨 선거말이나고요? 급진파는 결코 규칙을 따르지 않을 것입니다. 모두가 알고 있었습니다. 그는 모든 것이 괜찮은 척하는 대신 이 주와 이 연방을 건설한 제도들을 보존하기 위해 노력해야 했습니다. 자신이 그런 정치인이 된 것에 대해 스스로를 저주하면서 그는 빌어먹을 사무실로 차를 몰았습니다. 문을 열었을 때, 그는 이 모든 일에 대한 자신의 의견과 캘리포니아에 미칠 영향에 대해 묻는 현기증이 날 정도로 많은 기자들의 질문이 쏟아질 것이라고는 전혀 예상하지 못했습니다. \"현 상황에 대한 제 의견을 듣고 싶으신가요? 글쎄요, 할 말은 딱 하나뿐입니다. 우리는 이 상황을 극복할 겁니다. 왜 그런지 아십니까? 우리에게는 그렇게 할 수 있는 두뇌와 힘, 그리고 친절함이 있고, 사소한 일로 서로를 죽이고 싶지 않기 때문입니다. 우리는 다른 사람들이 그랬던 것처럼 무너지도록 스스로를 놔둘 수 없습니다. 우리가 아니면 누가 이 상황을 극복할 수 있겠습니까?\""

CAL.4.desc:0 "싱클레어가 거리를 걷는 동안 그의 눈앞에는 침체된 로스앤젤레스의 암울한 모습이 펼쳐졌습니다. 시장 붕괴에 이어 대통령 재임 중 발생한 재앙으로 인해 도시는 예전의 모습을 찾아볼 수 없었습니다. 한때 깨끗하고 아름다웠던 도시에서도 노숙자와 행상인을 흔히 볼 수 있게 되었고, 많은 건물이 버려진 채 빈 벽돌 껍데기처럼 서 있었습니다. 이 모든 것이 싱클레어를 괴롭게 했습니다. 이 나라의 거물급 인사들은 동정심이 전혀 없는 듯 보였고, 자신들의 헛소리가 이 나라를 어떻게 죽이고 있는지 전혀 알지 못했습니다. 국가는 자유주의 관료나 이 미치광이 보딘이 섬기는 사람이 아니라 선량한 국민을 돕기 위해 무언가를 해야 했습니다. 그의 메시지는 몽둥이만큼이나 직설적이고 단호했습니다. 캘리포니아의 빈곤을 종식시키라는 것이었습니다."
CAL.4.a:0 "자신의 자식들을 굶기는 나라는 결코 위대할 수 없다."
CAL.5.title:0 "강가의 평의회"
CAL.5.desc:0 "몇 달 동안 리버사이드의 조용한 낙원은 세계의 심장부가 될 것이었고, 스타인벡은 이를 직접 볼 수 있는 절호의 기회를 놓치지 않았습니다. 그는 수첩을 손에 들고 퇴폐적인 앤 여왕 양식의 저택과 관광객 친화적인 스페인 미션 양식의 호텔들을 거닐었습니다. 수백 명의 다른 기자들과 수십 명의 헌병들을 피하는 것은 어려운 일이었지만, 그의 운동신경이 감당할 수 없는 일은 아니었습니다. 그는 전체 광경을 조망할 수 있는 좋은 지점에 도달했습니다. 옛 법원에서 불과 몇 미터 떨어진 그곳에서는 모든 사람들을 쉽게 볼 수 있었습니다. 불길한 친구인 은행가 지아니니와 이야기를 나누고 있는 키가 크고 우울한 모습의 C. C. 영이 있었고, 멀지 않은 곳에 미온적인 민주당 의원 크릴이 평소처럼 같은 당 의원과 열띤 논쟁을 벌이고 있었습니다. 그는 클라크 글레이브, 스펜서 트레이시, 캐서린 헵번 등 영화에서 본 익숙한 얼굴들이 있는 걸 알아챘습니다. 헵번이 자신과 같은 투철한 좌파라는 얘기는 들었지만, 그녀는 두 사람의 영성주의적 소속을 문제 삼지 않는 듯했고, 세 사람은 함께 조용히 웃었습니다. 보딘이나 그의 부하 허바드는 리버사이드 평의회의 첫 회의에 참석하지 않은 것 같았습니다. 스타인벡은 유령 이야기와 사이비 영지주의에 대한 정신 분열증적인 헛소리를 듣고 있을 자신이 없다고 생각했기 때문에 이는 차라리 다행스러운 일이었습니다. 마침내 그의 눈은 그가 계속 찾던 남자를 만났습니다: 업튼 싱클레어였습니다. 공정하고 정의로운 캘리포니아를 위한 마지막 희망이었던 그는 죽어가는 주를 바꿀 기회를 박탈당했습니다. 주변에는 다른 사회주의자들이 수다를 떨고 있었지만 싱클레어는 혼자였습니다. 시간이 되자 각 당의 모든 사람들이 법원의 거대한 대리석 아치로 향했습니다. 금욕주의자인 싱클레어가 갑자기 행동에 나서며 의회를 향해 단호하게 걸어갔습니다. 오직 시간만이 결과를 말해줄 것입니다."

CAL.6.title:0 "KCW 방송 - 1"
CAL.6.desc:0 "진행자가 자리에 앉아 방송국에서 보낸 쪽지를 주의 깊게 읽는 동안 계산된 몇 초 동안의 극적인 정적이 흘렀습니다. 지금이 그의 라디오 진행 경력에서 가장 중요한 순간이 될 수도 있었습니다. 그는 마이크에서 벗어나 숨을 몰아쉬고 말을 하기 위해 고개를 돌렸습니다. 극도로 긴장한 상태였지만 그는 청취자들을 위해 최대한 단조롭고 명료하게 말을 이어갔습니다.\n“이것은 캘리포니아 주 비상위원회(이하 리버사이드 위원회)의 공식 발표입니다. 미합중국 연방 정부가 연방의 정상 상태를 유지할 수 없다고 판단하여, 캘리포니아는 이제부터 전국적으로 정상 상태가 회복될 때까지 정치적, 경제적으로 자급자족할 것입니다. 또한 캘리포니아는 미국의 남은 지역에 대한 어떠한 음모에도 동참하거나 참여하지 않을 것입니다. 이는 공식적인 중립 선언이며, 주권 영토에 대한 공격은 무력으로 대응할 것입니다. 상황에 대해 더 자세히 알고 싶은 시민은 모든 질문에 답변하도록 지시받은 지역 담당자에게 문의하십시오. 질서와 안정은 항상 유지될 것입니다. 캘리포니아에 신의 가호가 있기를, 미국에 신의 축복이 있기를.”\n모든 시민들의 라디오에서 "I Love You, California"의 노래 구절이 울려 퍼졌고, 수백만 명의 가정은 불확실한 미래를 느꼈습니다."

CAL.7.title:0 "실은 우리도 민주정"
CAL.7.desc:0 "최근 주 선거 연기와 리버사이드 평의회의 밀실 권력 분배 합의로 인해 잊혀진 한 가지는 새로운 캘리포니아 공화국이 여전히 민주주의 국가라는 사실입니다. 당면한 상황이 안정되면서 두 가지 사실이 분명해지고 있습니다. 첫째, 공화당, 민주당, 진보당, 영성주의자들이 합의할 수 있는 것이 거의 없다는 점과 둘째, 일반 대중이 정부에 발언권을 갖고 싶어한다는 점입니다. 우리에게는 선거가 필요합니다!\n\n새로운 주에서 처음으로 실시되는 연방 선거는 새로운 캘리포니아가 어떤 국가가 될 것인지를 결정하는 중요한 선거가 될 것입니다. 많은 것이 걸려 있기 때문에 극적인 경합이 벌어질 것으로 예상됩니다. 우리가 잘 견뎌낼 수 있기를 바랍니다."
CAL.7.a:0 "선거하러 갑시다!"
CAL.8.title:0 "KCW 방송 - 2"
CAL.8.desc:0 "\"새로운 청취자 여러분, 이번 특별 프로그램에서는 개표 결과가 발표될 때까지 총선의 최신 상황을 면밀히 주시하고 있다는 점을 다시 한 번 알려드립니다. 아직까지 로스앤젤레스에서 일부 싱클레어 지지자와 구 민주당 지지자 사이에 벌어진 길거리 난투극을 제외하고는 관련 사건은 발생하지 않았습니다. 모든 어려움과 불확실성에도 불구하고 우리의 아름다운 주에 희망과 이성이 있다는 것을 알게되어 기쁩니다. 결과는 곧 나올 것이며 리버사이드에 있는 담당자들이 전화를 걸어올 때까지 기다리기만 하면 됩니다. 누가 이길지 내기를 해보셨나요, 여러분?\"\n\n그는 잠시 멈추고 얼음을 넣은 위스키를 한 모금 마시고 더 편안한 자세를 찾기 위해 자리에서 몸을 움직였습니다. 그는 거의 두 시간 동안 이야기를 이어갔고, 중간중간 숨을 고르기 위해 몇 곡의 노래만 틀었을 뿐이었습니다. 그래도 그는 엄청나게 행복해했습니다. 그는 캘리포니아 역사상 가장 중요한 선거의 생생한 목소리였고, 백만 명의 가족들이 그의 입에서 나오는 모든 말에 귀를 기울이고 있었기 때문이었습니다. 그는 위스키를 맛보며 기뻐하고 만족해했습니다. 그의 프로듀서는 녹음 부스와 기술자 콘솔을 분리하는 창문을 두드리며 유리에 종이 한 장을 대고 있었습니다.\n\n\n\"방금 리버사이드 측에서 새로운 소식을 전달받았습니다! 결과는...\""

CAL.11.desc:0 "이전에도 5열주의자들과 주를 불안정하게 만들려는 음모에 대한 두려움이 강했다면, 동쪽의 데저레트 독립으로 인해 그 두려움은 더욱 불타올랐습니다. 몰몬교가 지배하는 유타주가 분리 독립하여 네바다주를 차지하자, 후기 성도 교회를 따르는 나머지 주민들 역시 의심의 눈초리를 받게 됐습니다. 몰몬교 정착민 인구가 많은 캘리포니아 내륙 지역이 그 다음 차례가 될까요? 연방 정부와 교회 간의 짧은 유타 전쟁이 이 주에 긴장을 불러일으킨 것은 불과 한 세기도 되지 않았습니다.\n\n공포가 커지면서 지역 몰몬교 공동체에 미친 영향은 극도로 부정적이었으며, 분노한 민간인들이 "적의 음모를 막기 위해" 국경으로 향했다가 당국에 의해 무시당하는 일이 발생했습니다. 표적이 된 사람들이 스스로를 방어하기 위해 뭉칠 때마다 그에 대한 이야기는 점점 더 커질 수밖에 없었습니다. 유타주 출신인 컬버트 올슨 민주당 의원은 사무실 기물 파손 사건에 휘말렸다가 가까스로 '조기 은퇴'를 면했지만, 캘리포니아 정치권 내에서도 후기 성도 교회와 연관된 인사들이 공격을 받고 있습니다."

CAL.18.desc:0 "Sinclair half-fell backward into his armchair as the message on the radio began to loop, feeling his stomach drop to somewhere on the ground floor. When he'd heard the first gunshots earlier in the evening, he hadn't wanted to believe it was happening - when the intermittent gunfire returned, he'd opened - fervently - that it was the national guard entering the city to put down Bodin's gang of robber-barons and Hollywood twits.  But it seemed like their paramilitaries and the former Federal troops who'd bought into… whatever it was that the Spiritualists stood for had been enough to overcome whatever resistance they'd encountered in Riverside.\nAnd there was nothing he could do about it. Whatever toughs he could scrounge together from EPIC-affiliated unions and student groups would be no match for trained soldiers, even if it would be possible to gather them in time to matter. Even if the Guard only put the bourgeois parties of the United Front back in power, at least he'd have the chance to take power in the next election cycle. But the Spiritualists would no doubt cease to hold public elections - the lunatic Christians had stolen a march on him; they'd moved too quickly for him to gain control of the new-born nation of California. He'd heard Bodin describe the American economy as sacred in the past, and given who supported them, they'd no doubt keep the system in its present form, or even worsen its exploitation of the proletariat. Poverty would persist - he'd let his chance to implement true socialism slip through his fingers.\nRising to unsteady feet, he made his way to the Cellarette, uncorked a bottle without looking, and took several deep gulps. Tomorrow would come, and perhaps there would be something he could do to salvage something from the situation. Bodin was insane - surely he had no chance of holding power for more than a few months. Sinclair took another drink. His day would come, surely. He just needed to wait. But maybe the best place to do that was somewhere outside of the reach of Bodin's cronies."

Wearing nothing but white robes that reflected the Sun's light and lit off rainbows against the sky. The wind gently touched their bodies and they removed their glasses, hats, and all other accessories, only feeling their long hairs against the wind as their spirits went into Astral Projection - and from then on, they met the Hyperborean world, where the original Alien Pre-Humans had come from, and then a vision of horror of the many Teegeeack which began invading the Earth. Subsequently, in this holy realm beyond Thrace, they looked around and saw constellations, galaxies, and other gorgeous planets. \n\n And then, Bodin told Hubbard; \"My child, we are not from this World; we are beyond Human, in fact, as Humanity entails Teegeeack-ness, and Ape-likeness. It is nescessary, that to reach Enlightenment, one must transcend beyond their Humanity, and live free. The Hyperboreans live in constant conflict with outside forces, be they Thetans or be they Ape.

However, one church in particular had armed itself to the teeth, and kept it's position and autonomy from the Government for months until a planned raid was about to occur. Thirty or so priests and deacons had prepared themselves with weapons, many of them Hispanic and considered the biggest enemy of the Golden Realm. Not only this church had a Spanish name, but was in the middle of beloved Los Angeles. This cannot be - and so a local convoy of militias, officially not part of the Government, called the \"Longstreet Battalion\" had finished their usual tasks of beating up zoot-suited Hispanics, and instead prepared to fight the greatest fight they had yet - those thirty armed priests and deacons ready to die for their Church. Inside this particular church, the Church of Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles, existed tripwire, sharp metals, and many bullets. At least, as many bullets as they could hold on to. And so, the Longstreet Battalion barged in through the use of explosive TNT, and began to fire with automatic weapons against the poorly-armed priests and churchgoers. As they got shot, they cried, screamed, moaned, and thought of their families. Yet, it was no use, as the few casualties on the Spiritualist side had resulted in nearly the entire church being wiped out of hostiles. The Church was then cleared for zoning of a new cinema set."

People suffer immensely without L Ron Hubbard's knowledge, and with his immense benevolence, he has decided to make an entire book on Dianetics freely available to be distributed across California as an introductory piece to the party line regarding spirituality. Regardless, the ideas within Excalibur, the more obscure and \"forbidden\" book to \"lower OT level\" audiences, itself are downright pagan; there is nothing in them that talks about Christ or God, and instead focus moreso on direct situations of spirituality that can be adressed and cared for, such as the Thetans, and the whole situation regarding the origin of Humanity, which L Ron Hubbard believes is of the story of the Galactic Confederacy, where their Dictator, Xenu, had brought billions of Teegeeack to Earth and subsequently stacked them around Volcanoes, then killed them with enormous bombs of unimagined, alien scale. The thetans, or immortal spirits of these creatures attach to humans and create several ailments and diseases, such as anxiety, panic disorder, schizophrenia, etcetera.

That is something only true Californians can understand. We already offer spiritual enhancement to civilians in every street corner, why not subsidize it for military production? Then, and only then could we fight on every plane of reality.\"\n\"YES!\" The man who was scratching his hand stands a bit too quickly, and claps a bit too loudly. His comrades look to him in shock, and even Bodin himself seems taken aback, albeit receptive to the enthusiasm. After a few moments however, more officers begin to stand, with only the most traditionalist generals staying seated.

Namely, the decision to uphold and expand some of the government programs that were put in place under the Cox presidency - you remember those days, don't you? - and the decision to uphold segregation as a source of Californian stability. After that, we'll have someone from the Californian Republican Party in to discuss why he thinks neither of those will work and why the country should liberalize.

The frontman for the previous coalition government is once again taking the oath of office - somewhat controversially saying “I will affirm” rather than “so help me God.” President Olson, architect of some of the more progressive policies of the United Front period, is expected to expand aid policies that the former federal government implemented, including strong subsidies for Californian agriculture.\n\nHowever, the rosy picture painted of the new President belies his tensions with the party. The staunch progressive is at the head of a party that broke with the Front in part over the issue of segregation. Supposedly, the decision to exile Upton Sinclair (though you didn't hear it from me) was also made over his objections. What this means for California is anyone's guess, though at least one joke in the press has been that they hope it doesn't split another party."

The American government used to broadly ignore farmers in distress, and look how it turned out for them. It is against our best interests for the cornerstone of society to live from cheque to cheque.

Recall France and Russia's repudiation of their debts, or most recently the Asiatics and their Sunset Crash.\n\nUnlike several of the lesser states of the former Union, California has the resources and land to support itself.

The itinerant workers? Maybe, but the harvest he had coming would be harder to finish, and if he didn't sell all of it would he be worse off than if he let it rot?

Or so the report on his desk was being euphemistic about.\nWho were they kidding? He'd just emboldened a bunch of zealots to lynch some poor Mexican who was hanging around in the wrong part of town. Probably had no idea what he was being assailed over.

What we are adopting, however, is our very own incarnation of the American Electoral College. Whichever candidate receives the most electoral votes, which are allocated by district to who has the most votes in each, will win the election.

Millions live in absolute destitution caused by the callous and close-minded minds of rich old business executive based in Sacramento running over the good people in this state. I, being the naive man of the age of the great Gilded, after a brief scuffle with some police officers while trying to organize, decided in a fit of both wisdom and cowardice, that I was unsuited for political life and could only hope to change the system via encouraging others with my writing. A year passed by, then decades. While I could see quite clearly that my writing had indeed changed a lot of good people's minds on fixing this broken system, I slowly began to realize that the Grand Progressives in the Capitol and in state politics were only using my work as a means to gain votes, not to actually carry on the torch of reform. In 1934 I got so sick of the whole matter that I signed up with the Jobless Progressive Party to try and win that a way, and though we were close, we did not win in California. But we are not in 1934 anymore. Things have only gotten worse and it is completely clear to me that we have got to fix it.

That is why I want to let you know that we are about to unveil our new school policy, and while it does sound a bit radical, I hope that you and I can both agree that it is absolutely necessary. There are millions of children and young adults in this state that can't afford to have a secondary education and I think you know how horrible this deprivation of an experience is for them.

Mr. Morgan had some troubles with the Great Depression with business drying up rather quickly, but being the kindly neighbour that he is, he was sure to lower the prices of his goods or even give them out for free to the honest working people who needed it. Mr. Morgan was never quite one for politics and never joined any party, he saw no need too, for he knew everyone from the JPP to the Technocrats and knew they would be good enough. Things continued on for Mr. Morgan, until the collapse of the nation and the death of the United States. Things didn't change all that much in his material circumstances, but he had grown up with respect and love of his country. His soon carefree and optimistic nature on politics evaporated, and Mr. Morgan became one of the most anti-socialist people in his village, and well renown for refusing service to any JPP member that had, in his mind, betrayed his country.

Morgan tried to do, Mr. Sinclair was elected to the Governorship anyhow. Mr. Morgan's melancholy and anger grew, until the traitor came to his own town. He could see the smug fag right outside his shop window. After Sinclair finished up his little speech about how he was supposedly \"fighting for the little guy\" and seeing many supporters cheering him on, he found himself in a deep unquenchable sense of hopelessness and melancholy. Thus, he went to the back of his shop, grabbed the old New Army he kept around, and begged God for the situation to improve for his country, people, and family."

The bill in question will give workers, especially railroad workers, such things as an 8 hour workday, paid vacation, the unquestioned right to form a union, and much to my personal delight, a mandate that each worker must be given atleast one share in the company in which he is employed. I came down here this fine afternoon to inform you of this so your company can make the necessary adjustments to conform to this new piece of legislation. If you have no further questions, I'll be leaving then.\" McCgider could hardly believe what he had just heard. He knew he was not going to enjoy this meeting, but the Governor had stunned him with the sheer radicalness of the plan. The numbers of such regulation reeling in his head, he soon locked eyes with Sinclair, \"No.\" he said. \"I do not Governor.\" \"Alright then. Have a good day then.\""

Got to meet with the Governor today.\" This was a bad sign. Kathlein knew that Robert had no love of Upton Sinclair, and him personally going down to his office meant that it was to inform him of a new policy, something that, knowing the Governor's rhetoric and record, was sure not to go over well with her spouse. \"And how was that?\" Robert, now pouring himself a glass of Scotch, took a big sigh. \"About as well as you could expect. Man's got a penchent for proposing big things, and today was none the different. A mandatory eight hour workday, mandatory worker owned shares, mandatory paid vacation time, soon they're bill mandatory daily picnics and mandatory worker sporting clubs. We're set to lose big, today I got screamed at for such a blunder, \"Negotiate!\" they said after I broke the news. Negotiate what? The man was absolutely hellbent on this new thing he's doing, I could see it in his eyes honey, he was going to have his way no matter what, and I don't want our company to be remembered the next time there's an inspection sweep going around. I'm sure that we can get by it, but I'm old enough already and I don't want this company to go belly up because of this, you know?\" Kathlein soon felt much better. Things had been rough for her baby, and he was just a little peeved, nothing a good deal of love and care couldn't fix in him. Smiling warmly she expressed empathy at his situation, and offered to make him a big ham tonight for super."

Life was not easy for young Macdawson, but now things were looking up. The new mandatory work programs meant he now got a job at the Oakland County Public Works Administration. The free schooling and housing meant he could finally learn after his 8 hour day for an hour or two and then greet his kids, who at that time were also finishing up at school.

CAL.145.desc:0 "It's been years since Bodin had subverted the Californian Government and sent a sacred Cosmic War against the Hidden Rulers, maintaining the Bell Line and keeping several teeming and thriving new religious movements across the United States. Despite everything, Bodin is exhausted, yet restless. He feels as if there is a great conflict among the various factions of the Realm. Generally, it is believed that if Bodin resigns, then a faction will emerge dominant as per the choice that Bodin gave in his announcement of resignation. Not only this will mean a totally different direction of the Spiritual Realm, and it will mean different foreign policy alignements. Bodin wonders in his latest letter, writing slowly with a shaky hand, wondering if he should return to writing science fiction and books on spiritual matters, or maintain the center of the Spiritualist movement and keep out every other faction from dominance, allowing a balanced government and political system. And so, Bodin begins to write..."

CAL.146.desc:0 "Edward Longstreet Bodin, the 1st President of the Spiritual Realm of America, has decided to resign in favor of allowing a new successor to arise in his favor. The factions which most expect to succeed Bodin's government are the Dianetic Research Foundation's ministry, led by L. Ron Hubbard, which seek to orient the nation into a \"filter\" system, where the most devoted to Dianetics are given further information of its beliefs. This system of course ends in a somewhat oligarchic government, however it promises to maintain the corporatist economics that Bodin and his associates have managed. Aside from everything, L. Ron Hubbard is massively influential and has been considered Bodin's pupil, meaning his chance of being nominated Bodin's successor is the most likely case. However - there are multiple factions which have gained Bodin's favor through favors, money, intimidation, agreements, or all of the above: The Unarius Academy of Science has sought to largely influence Bodin's cabinet and Bodin himself through their ideas of reincarnation and past life regression. Their ostensible status as a \"scientific academy\" means that they've received much political power, especially due to their longtime heardquartering in El Cajon, Southern California, being one of the most ardent supporters of Bodin's government. Finally, a few other choices remain, being Jack Parsons and his clique of magick eccentrics, who have been briefly associated with Thelema or have been associated with Theosophy and other older religious movements. Their economics is left largely ambiguous, but it can be expected it will not be utilitarian in mindset, and instead will seek to fund spiritual matters even more than Bodin's America already had.\n\nThe black sheep of these factions, however is an emerging new religious movement led by a mysterious Krishna Venta, who operates out of Los Angeles. The movement, called Fountain of the World, is centered around Krishna, who claims to be Christ - and not only this, but that he was born on another, far away planet named Neophrates, which was Humanity's first home. Soon becoming uninhabitable as it reached closer and closer to the Sun, rocketships flew out of the planet holding tens of thousands of people - and most importantly, it was led by the spirit which now occupies Krishna's body, who presented revelations to multiple important religious figures across the World. Krishna has finalized most of his vision of History in writing, and in large crowded events. Despite the serious distinctfulness of Krishna's new religious movement, it also has large Theosophy and LDS Church influences in it's perspectives on spiritual and cosmic matters. Nonetheless, what matters at the end is who Ed Bodin, the reincarnation of Jean Bodin and the Spiritual Leader of America, who will remain respected like a new Washington for the remainder of his physical life in this planet, chose to succeed him. So, as the Senate looks into his latest letter to the Government, it says..."

CAL_naval_discussions:0 "해군 토의"
CAL_naval_discussions_desc:0 "California has long been a center of US Navy operations in the pacific. Having assumed independent authority, we must now decide how many of these operations we can still support, and which remain necessary to defend our interests."
CAL_bay_area_expansion:0 "Bay Area 확장"
CAL_bay_area_expansion_desc:0 "The bay area has excellent geography to support maritime shipping and military operations – we must take steps to expand it to support the operations of our new fleet."
CAL_new_dockyards:0 "새 선착장들"
CAL_new_dockyards_desc:0 "To maintain a fleet, we must have the shipyards and naval industries to repair our ships and replace obsolete vessels. We already possess a meaning network of shipyards scattered along our coastline; we will expand these yards, and ensure that the required supporting industries are protected."
CAL_carrier_experiments:0 "항공모함 실험"
CAL_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Air attacks offer intriguing possibilities for the destruction of even enemy capital ships using relatively inexpensive aircraft. To make use of naval air power deep in the open Pacific, we will require carrier vessels able to launch, recover, and support our strike craft."
CAL_submarine_doctrine:0 "잠수함 교리"
CAL_submarine_doctrine_desc:0 "While we may not be able to destroy larger navies in direct confrontations, the use of submarines in an indirect approach to attack enemy shipping lines and support ships may allow us to keep enemies off our shores."
CAL_fleet_in_being_focus:0 "존재하는 함대"
CAL_fleet_in_being_focus_desc:0 "Even if we cannot crush the enemy with our line of battle, keeping a deadly fleet ready to sortie from well-protected ports will force them to utilize their own naval assets much more cautiously, allowing us to degrade their effectiveness without needing to risk direct confrontation."
CAL_against_a_bigger_opponent:0 "더 큰 적에 맞서 우리를 이기리라"

CAL_californian_militias_into_army_desc:0 "With the fall of the United States - and the fracturing of the United States Army with it – it is imperative that we immediately mobilize the California National Guard, and re-organize it in preparation to expand it into a full-scale army."
CAL_what_doctrine:0 "무슨 교리?"
CAL_what_doctrine_desc:0 "With the creation of our own army, it now falls to us to decide on a direction for our forces. It would be best to make this decision now, before we being independently procurement equipment and indoctrinating the first class of our new officer corps."
CAL_artillery_attacks:0 "Artillery Attacks"
CAL_artillery_attacks_desc:0 "We do not have the deep pool of manpower the United States as a whole once did, or even a population of the size we must assume the warlords back east can call upon. As such, it is imperative that we take every step to fight as efficiently as possible, using flexible artillery firing on pre-planned barrage patterns to break up the assaults of the enemy, then shatter his strongpoints."
CAL_barrages_of_fire:0 "포화"

CAL_speedy_effectiveness:0 "Speedy Effectiveness"
CAL_speedy_effectiveness_desc:0 "Interwar exercises have shown that quick-moving mechanized forces, swift planning, and robust communications are the key to avoiding the misery of the trenches. As we cannot expect to win a protracted war of attrition, the Army of California must be ready and able to fight using the most modern methods."
CAL_mobile_frontlines:0 "Mobile Frontlines"
CAL_mobile_frontlines_desc:0 "When fighting across the vast spaces of the western United States, small forces will not be able to form solid front lines and remain constantly in contact with each other. While we must be ever-vigilant for enemy infiltration attacks, this also gives us the opportunity to win quickly victories by circumventing and enveloping large sections of an enemy force. Accordingly, at every level of command, our officers will be prepared to assume command of independent manoeuvre units and to independently make decisions to accomplish mission goals."
CAL_tank_and_truck_research:0 "전차 및 트럭 연구"
CAL_tank_and_truck_research_desc:0 "Motorized forces are essential to projecting power into the vast spaces of the American interior, and tanks are essential to efficiently assault modern enemy forces.

CAL_well_carried_out_plans_desc:0 "When we might fight the enemy head-on, our assaults will be well coordinated to shatter them as quickly as possible with pre-sighted artillery fire and armored thrusts across well-scouted ground. Sweat saves blood, and we will not sacrifice the life of a single son of California beyond what is absolutely necessary."
