CAL.1.title:0 "아 용사가 쓰러진 건 얼마나 됐던가"
CAL.1.desc:0 "캘리포니아에 오신 것을 환영합니다.  여러분이 어떻게 이곳에 도착했는지와 상관없이, 미국은 이미 무너졌습니다. 우리가 왔던 바다에서 우리가 도착한 빛나는 바다까지, 우리의 공정한 국가 외에는 더 이상 중요하지 않습니다. 제임스타운의 후예들은 우리는 마침내 죽음이라는, 미국이란 실험의 논리적 결론에 도달했습니다. \n\n 그리하여, 빈곤 속에 부스러기나 모으며 살아가야 할지라도 우리는 조각들을 모아 삶을 이어 나가야 합니다. 거리에선 사람들이 죽어가고 리버사이드 평의회는 형편없이 배분된 자원들을 갖고서 질서를 유지하고자 최선을 다하고 있는 데다 전반적으로 혼돈이 퍼지고 있습니다. 하지만 미국이라는 실험에서 파생된 이 새로운 실험에는 애국적 심원도 있습니다. 어쩌면 여기선 좋은 결과가 있을지도 모르죠."
CAL.1.a:0 "어쩌면 이게 우리의 미래일지도."
CAL.2.title:0 "두려움에 떨 준비를 하라!"
CAL.2.desc:0 "보딘은 자신의 아파트에서 괴물의 세계가 손짓하는 가운데 석양이 캘리포니아의 선량한 사람들을 집어삼키는 것을 바라보았습니다. 빛이 서서히 사라지자 그는 이미 악마와 불경한 존재가 공기 중에 현현하는 것을 느낄 수 있었습니다. 온 세상에 악령, 좀비, 유령, 외계인, 그리고 인간들의 결점까지 악의 기운이 해가 지고 나자 퍼져나가고 있었습니다. 그는 몇 시간 동안 세상이 암흑으로 변하는 것을 창밖으로 바라보았습니다. 그 후 그는 세상과 단절하고 환상의 영역으로 행복하게 들어가려고 했지만, 문제는 계속 그를 갉아먹었고 신이 태양을 다시 보낼 때까지 초자연적인 영역에 머물러야만 했습니다. 하지만 혼자서 이 싸움을 하는 것은 무의미하다고 생각한 그는 어둠 속에서 조금이나마 위안을 얻기 위해 평소 즐겨보던 방송국 중 하나인 KCW를 틀었습니다. 하지만 방송 내용은 어둠이 그의 제한된 육체적 시력보다 훨씬 더 깊숙이 침투해 있다는 것을 보여주었습니다. 동부의 상황이 급격히 악화되고 있으며 내전이 임박했다는 공포스러운 이야기가 방송에 나왔습니다. '당연히' 그는 혼자 조용히 중얼거렸습니다. '동쪽에는 어둠이 더 일찍 오는구나'. 그 발표는 그를 두려움에 휩싸이게 했지만, 한편으로는 예상하지 못했던 또 다른 희망으로 가득 차게 했습니다. 그는 어둠이 언젠가는 끝날 것이라는 것을 알고 있었지만... 그 시기가 앞당겨질 수 있다면 세상에 더 좋지 않을까요? 사람들은 그것을 '계몽'이라고 불렀습니다, 횃불이라고 말이지요... 그렇죠! 그는 깨달은 즉시 겁에 질린 교환원에게 전화를 걸었고, 마침내 영원의 목표가 다가온다는 설렘으로 그는 물었습니다;"
CAL.2.a:0 "\"연락원? Alan Frost로 연결해!\""
CAL.3.title:0 "올슨의 몽상"
CAL.3.desc:0 "올슨은 그 생각을 견디기 힘들었습니다. 동부는 끝났다는 것을 그는 알고 있었습니다. 아나키스트들은 자신들이 하고자 하는 짓을 다했고, 군대는 반란을 일으켰으며, 상황은 사실상 끝났다는 걸 말입니다. 하지만 오늘 그가 해야 할 일은 그게 아니었습니다. 오늘 그는 선거 운동을 위해 다른 회의에 참석해야 했습니다. 무슨 선거말이나고요? 급진파는 결코 규칙을 따르지 않을 것입니다. 모두가 알고 있었습니다. 그는 모든 것이 괜찮은 척하는 대신 이 주와 이 연방을 건설한 제도들을 보존하기 위해 노력해야 했습니다. 자신이 그런 정치인이 된 것에 대해 스스로를 저주하면서 그는 빌어먹을 사무실로 차를 몰았습니다. 문을 열었을 때, 그는 이 모든 일에 대한 자신의 의견과 캘리포니아에 미칠 영향에 대해 묻는 현기증이 날 정도로 많은 기자들의 질문이 쏟아질 것이라고는 전혀 예상하지 못했습니다. \"현 상황에 대한 제 의견을 듣고 싶으신가요? 글쎄요, 할 말은 딱 하나뿐입니다. 우리는 이 상황을 극복할 겁니다. 왜 그런지 아십니까? 우리에게는 그렇게 할 수 있는 두뇌와 힘, 그리고 친절함이 있고, 사소한 일로 서로를 죽이고 싶지 않기 때문입니다. 우리는 다른 사람들이 그랬던 것처럼 무너지도록 스스로를 놔둘 수 없습니다. 우리가 아니면 누가 이 상황을 극복할 수 있겠습니까?\""
CAL.3.a:0 "\"아직 답을 못 들었는데.\""
CAL.4.title:0 "아 그래, 이거 좀 쩌는데"
CAL.4.desc:0 "싱클레어가 거리를 걷는 동안 그의 눈앞에는 침체된 로스앤젤레스의 암울한 모습이 펼쳐졌습니다. 시장 붕괴에 이어 대통령 재임 중 발생한 재앙으로 인해 도시는 예전의 모습을 찾아볼 수 없었습니다. 한때 깨끗하고 아름다웠던 도시에서도 노숙자와 행상인을 흔히 볼 수 있게 되었고, 많은 건물이 버려진 채 빈 벽돌 껍데기처럼 서 있었습니다. 이 모든 것이 싱클레어를 괴롭게 했습니다. 이 나라의 거물급 인사들은 동정심이 전혀 없는 듯 보였고, 자신들의 헛소리가 이 나라를 어떻게 죽이고 있는지 전혀 알지 못했습니다. 국가는 자유주의 관료나 이 미치광이 보딘이 섬기는 사람이 아니라 선량한 국민을 돕기 위해 무언가를 해야 했습니다. 그의 메시지는 몽둥이만큼이나 직설적이고 단호했습니다. 캘리포니아의 빈곤을 종식시키라는 것이었습니다."
CAL.4.a:0 "자신의 자식들을 굶기는 나라는 결코 위대할 수 없다."
CAL.5.title:0 "강가의 평의회"
CAL.5.desc:0 "몇 달 동안 리버사이드의 조용한 낙원은 세계의 심장부가 될 것이었고, 스타인벡은 이를 직접 볼 수 있는 절호의 기회를 놓치지 않았습니다. 그는 수첩을 손에 들고 퇴폐적인 앤 여왕 양식의 저택과 관광객 친화적인 스페인 미션 양식의 호텔들을 거닐었습니다. 수백 명의 다른 기자들과 수십 명의 헌병들을 피하는 것은 어려운 일이었지만, 그의 운동신경이 감당할 수 없는 일은 아니었습니다. 그는 전체 광경을 조망할 수 있는 좋은 지점에 도달했습니다. 옛 법원에서 불과 몇 미터 떨어진 그곳에서는 모든 사람들을 쉽게 볼 수 있었습니다. 불길한 친구인 은행가 지아니니와 이야기를 나누고 있는 키가 크고 우울한 모습의 C. C. 영이 있었고, 멀지 않은 곳에 미온적인 민주당 의원 크릴이 평소처럼 같은 당 의원과 열띤 논쟁을 벌이고 있었습니다. 그는 클라크 글레이브, 스펜서 트레이시, 캐서린 헵번 등 영화에서 본 익숙한 얼굴들이 있는 걸 알아챘습니다. 헵번이 자신과 같은 투철한 좌파라는 얘기는 들었지만, 그녀는 두 사람의 영성주의적 소속을 문제 삼지 않는 듯했고, 세 사람은 함께 조용히 웃었습니다. 보딘이나 그의 부하 허바드는 리버사이드 평의회의 첫 회의에 참석하지 않은 것 같았습니다. 스타인벡은 유령 이야기와 사이비 영지주의에 대한 정신 분열증적인 헛소리를 듣고 있을 자신이 없다고 생각했기 때문에 이는 차라리 다행스러운 일이었습니다. 마침내 그의 눈은 그가 계속 찾던 남자를 만났습니다: 업튼 싱클레어였습니다. 공정하고 정의로운 캘리포니아를 위한 마지막 희망이었던 그는 죽어가는 주를 바꿀 기회를 박탈당했습니다. 주변에는 다른 사회주의자들이 수다를 떨고 있었지만 싱클레어는 혼자였습니다. 시간이 되자 각 당의 모든 사람들이 법원의 거대한 대리석 아치로 향했습니다. 금욕주의자인 싱클레어가 갑자기 행동에 나서며 의회를 향해 단호하게 걸어갔습니다. 오직 시간만이 결과를 말해줄 것입니다."
CAL.5.a:0 "캘리포니아의 궐위기가 시작되는구나."
CAL.6.title:0 "KCW 방송 - 1"
CAL.6.desc:0 "진행자가 자리에 앉아 방송국에서 보낸 쪽지를 주의 깊게 읽는 동안 계산된 몇 초 동안의 극적인 정적이 흘렀습니다. 지금이 그의 라디오 진행 경력에서 가장 중요한 순간이 될 수도 있었습니다. 그는 마이크에서 벗어나 숨을 몰아쉬고 말을 하기 위해 고개를 돌렸습니다. 극도로 긴장한 상태였지만 그는 청취자들을 위해 최대한 단조롭고 명료하게 말을 이어갔습니다.\n“이것은 캘리포니아 주 비상위원회(이하 리버사이드 위원회)의 공식 발표입니다. 미합중국 연방 정부가 연방의 정상 상태를 유지할 수 없다고 판단하여, 캘리포니아는 이제부터 전국적으로 정상 상태가 회복될 때까지 정치적, 경제적으로 자급자족할 것입니다. 또한 캘리포니아는 미국의 남은 지역에 대한 어떠한 음모에도 동참하거나 참여하지 않을 것입니다. 이는 공식적인 중립 선언이며, 주권 영토에 대한 공격은 무력으로 대응할 것입니다. 상황에 대해 더 자세히 알고 싶은 시민은 모든 질문에 답변하도록 지시받은 지역 담당자에게 문의하십시오. 질서와 안정은 항상 유지될 것입니다. 캘리포니아에 신의 가호가 있기를, 미국에 신의 축복이 있기를.”\n모든 시민들의 라디오에서 "I Love You, California"의 노래 구절이 울려 퍼졌고, 수백만 명의 가정은 불확실한 미래를 느꼈습니다."
CAL.6.a:0 "해 지는 주가 떠오른다"
CAL.7.title:0 "실은 우리도 민주정"
CAL.7.desc:0 "최근 주 선거 연기와 리버사이드 평의회의 밀실 권력 분배 합의로 인해 잊혀진 한 가지는 새로운 캘리포니아 공화국이 여전히 민주주의 국가라는 사실입니다. 당면한 상황이 안정되면서 두 가지 사실이 분명해지고 있습니다. 첫째, 공화당, 민주당, 진보당, 영성주의자들이 합의할 수 있는 것이 거의 없다는 점과 둘째, 일반 대중이 정부에 발언권을 갖고 싶어한다는 점입니다. 우리에게는 선거가 필요합니다!\n\n새로운 주에서 처음으로 실시되는 연방 선거는 새로운 캘리포니아가 어떤 국가가 될 것인지를 결정하는 중요한 선거가 될 것입니다. 많은 것이 걸려 있기 때문에 극적인 경합이 벌어질 것으로 예상됩니다. 우리가 잘 견뎌낼 수 있기를 바랍니다."
CAL.7.a:0 "선거하러 갑시다!"
CAL.8.title:0 "KCW 방송 - 2"
CAL.8.desc:0 "\"새로운 청취자 여러분, 이번 특별 프로그램에서는 개표 결과가 발표될 때까지 총선의 최신 상황을 면밀히 주시하고 있다는 점을 다시 한 번 알려드립니다. 아직까지 로스앤젤레스에서 일부 싱클레어 지지자와 구 민주당 지지자 사이에 벌어진 길거리 난투극을 제외하고는 관련 사건은 발생하지 않았습니다. 모든 어려움과 불확실성에도 불구하고 우리의 아름다운 주에 희망과 이성이 있다는 것을 알게되어 기쁩니다. 결과는 곧 나올 것이며 리버사이드에 있는 담당자들이 전화를 걸어올 때까지 기다리기만 하면 됩니다. 누가 이길지 내기를 해보셨나요, 여러분?\"\n\n그는 잠시 멈추고 얼음을 넣은 위스키를 한 모금 마시고 더 편안한 자세를 찾기 위해 자리에서 몸을 움직였습니다. 그는 거의 두 시간 동안 이야기를 이어갔고, 중간중간 숨을 고르기 위해 몇 곡의 노래만 틀었을 뿐이었습니다. 그래도 그는 엄청나게 행복해했습니다. 그는 캘리포니아 역사상 가장 중요한 선거의 생생한 목소리였고, 백만 명의 가족들이 그의 입에서 나오는 모든 말에 귀를 기울이고 있었기 때문이었습니다. 그는 위스키를 맛보며 기뻐하고 만족해했습니다. 그의 프로듀서는 녹음 부스와 기술자 콘솔을 분리하는 창문을 두드리며 유리에 종이 한 장을 대고 있었습니다.\n\n\n\"방금 리버사이드 측에서 새로운 소식을 전달받았습니다! 결과는...\""

CAL.9.title:0 "제퍼슨의 그릇된 관념"
CAL.9.desc:0 "제퍼슨은 우리 나라 위에 있는 농담거리 그 자체입니다. 산악지대를 간신히 지키며 장난감 총을 들고 베개 요새에 숨어 있는 양철 병사들이 농촌 자치에 대해 징징거리고 있는데, 그들이 그렇게 거만하지 않았다면 우리가 기꺼이 논의할 만한 사안이었습니다. 지금이야말로 우리가 사랑하는 캘리포니아, 황금의 나라, 쾌활함, 우리의 아름다움을 약화시키고 있는 분리주의자들에 대해 무언가를 해야 할 때입니다! 물, 자원, 곡물 수확을 위해 우리의 소중한 시골 땅과 산을 되찾으려면 어떤 대가를 치르더라도 그들을 막아야 할 것입니다! 이 자원이 없으면 우리 국민들의 수가 줄어들 것입니다! 어쨌든 그것은 리버사이드 평의회에 필요한 정당성을 부여할 것입니다."

CAL.11.title:0 "몰몬의 위협"
CAL.11.desc:0 "이전에도 5열주의자들과 주를 불안정하게 만들려는 음모에 대한 두려움이 강했다면, 동쪽의 데저레트 독립으로 인해 그 두려움은 더욱 불타올랐습니다. 몰몬교가 지배하는 유타주가 분리 독립하여 네바다주를 차지하자, 후기 성도 교회를 따르는 나머지 주민들 역시 의심의 눈초리를 받게 됐습니다. 몰몬교 정착민 인구가 많은 캘리포니아 내륙 지역이 그 다음 차례가 될까요? 연방 정부와 교회 간의 짧은 유타 전쟁이 이 주에 긴장을 불러일으킨 것은 불과 한 세기도 되지 않았습니다.\n\n공포가 커지면서 지역 몰몬교 공동체에 미친 영향은 극도로 부정적이었으며, 분노한 민간인들이 "적의 음모를 막기 위해" 국경으로 향했다가 당국에 의해 무시당하는 일이 발생했습니다. 표적이 된 사람들이 스스로를 방어하기 위해 뭉칠 때마다 그에 대한 이야기는 점점 더 커질 수밖에 없었습니다. 유타주 출신인 컬버트 올슨 민주당 의원은 사무실 기물 파손 사건에 휘말렸다가 가까스로 '조기 은퇴'를 면했지만, 캘리포니아 정치권 내에서도 후기 성도 교회와 연관된 인사들이 공격을 받고 있습니다."

"언제나처럼, 즐거운 시간입니다. 이제 리버사이드의 최신 소식을 전하는 뉴스 보도로 돌아가겠습니다. 시청자 여러분도 아시다시피 지난 몇 달 동안 이 상황에 대해 성실히 여러분께 소식을 전해 왔으며 오늘도 마찬가지입니다. 곧 다가오는 선거에 대해 논의하는 시간을 가질 것 같습니다! 흥미롭지 않나요, 여러분? 첫 번째 발표자는 -”\n\n갑자기 큰 소리로 진행자의 진행이 중단되었고, 두 번째 목소리가 진행자의 주의를 끌기 위해 소리를 질렀습니다. 그 후 1분 동안 웅얼거리는 속삭임과 청중 중 누구도 알아들을 수 없는 긴장된 대화가 이어졌습니다. 마침내 몇 초 동안 완전한 침묵이 흐른 후 원래의 목소리가 다시 나왔습니다. 그러나 이제 그의 목소리는 금방이라도 정신이 무너져 내리거나 절망적으로 울기 시작할 것처럼 삐걱거리고 부서지기 일보 직전이었습니다. "이건... 맙소사. 비극적으로 보고해야만 할 수밖에 없겠습니다..." 이번에는 정말 그가 수천 명의 청중 앞에서 어린아이처럼 흐느끼는 것처럼 들렸고, 청중들은 방금 일어난 일이 그에게 이렇게 큰 영향을 미쳤을 것이라는 사실에 혼란스러워 했고 일부는 겁에 질렸습니다.

CAL.115.desc:0 "In 1934 I wrote a pamphlet outlining 'if' I were Governor of California. It was an immensely popular piece of writing, so I've been told by well-wishers and friends. A lot of people liked it, because they understood that I have never wanted to be the Governor of this grand state. In those times I was renowned for the one thing I am well at, writing. I love California, I love her people, I love her luscious valleys and farms, but I have known from a young age that this state has a terrible secret. Millions live in absolute destitution caused by the callous and close-minded minds of rich old business executive based in Sacramento running over the good people in this state. I, being the naive man of the age of the great Gilded, after a brief scuffle with some police officers while trying to organize, decided in a fit of both wisdom and cowardice, that I was unsuited for political life and could only hope to change the system via encouraging others with my writing. A year passed by, then decades. While I could see quite clearly that my writing had indeed changed a lot of good people's minds on fixing this broken system, I slowly began to realize that the Grand Progressives in the Capitol and in state politics were only using my work as a means to gain votes, not to actually carry on the torch of reform. In 1934 I got so sick of the whole matter that I signed up with the Jobless Progressive Party to try and win that a way, and though we were close, we did not win in California. But we are not in 1934 anymore. Things have only gotten worse and it is completely clear to me that we have got to fix it. I already decided what I were to do if I were the Governor of California, I can now say with certainty that I am, and now all that's left to do is to answer the question \"When I was Governor of California...\"."

And seemed to continued as Governor of California. As he sat down with Mark Keppel, the meeting seemed to be going well. Keppler was a known supporter of full public education, and as the superintendent of Los Angeles County he had made no mistake as to his excitement for such a reformer entering the governorship. As the two men got to conversation, Sinclair quickly turned the subject to the matter of schooling, \"Mr. Keppler I think it is safe to assume from what you have said that you, as much as any man, value the right of children to have an education. That is why I want to let you know that we are about to unveil our new school policy, and while it does sound a bit radical, I hope that you and I can both agree that it is absolutely necessary. There are millions of children and young adults in this state that can't afford to have a secondary education and I think you know how horrible this deprivation of an experience is for them. That is why we have decided within Sacramento to begin issuing free public education all the way until post-graduate and even beyond should the student so choose. I hope we can have your full backing on this.\" Keppler rose from his seat. He had valued a public education for as long as he could remember, even going to back to when he was a simple high school teacher. But this? What Sinclair was proposing was more radical then even he as a student at UCLA could have dreamt up. Did he say free tuition all the way up to post-graduate? Taking a second to compose himself he then gave a warm smile to the most powerful man in California and thanked him for his efforts, though the entire time after they had both left his office, he couldn't shake the feeling he had made a terrible mistake."

Morgan inherited his father's general store just on the right of Main Street and has ran it ever since his passing in 1921. For the last few years Morgan has lived a simple yet fulfilling life as a well-liked, well respected, and moderately wealthy shopkeeper in a pretty little town in a nice state filled with kindly and good people. Mr. Morgan had some troubles with the Great Depression with business drying up rather quickly, but being the kindly neighbour that he is, he was sure to lower the prices of his goods or even give them out for free to the honest working people who needed it. Mr. Morgan was never quite one for politics and never joined any party, he saw no need too, for he knew everyone from the JPP to the Technocrats and knew they would be good enough. Things continued on for Mr. Morgan, until the collapse of the nation and the death of the United States. Things didn't change all that much in his material circumstances, but he had grown up with respect and love of his country. His soon carefree and optimistic nature on politics evaporated, and Mr. Morgan became one of the most anti-socialist people in his village, and well renown for refusing service to any JPP member that had, in his mind, betrayed his country. The poor man soon became melancholic and nostalgic. He was a harsh campaigner for Olson's United Front, and openly sought to do everything in his power to end the \"Reds\" from taking office in his county. Though for all poor Mr. Samuel P. Morgan tried to do, Mr. Sinclair was elected to the Governorship anyhow. Mr. Morgan's melancholy and anger grew, until the traitor came to his own town. He could see the smug fag right outside his shop window. After Sinclair finished up his little speech about how he was supposedly \"fighting for the little guy\" and seeing many supporters cheering him on, he found himself in a deep unquenchable sense of hopelessness and melancholy. Thus, he went to the back of his shop, grabbed the old New Army he kept around, and begged God for the situation to improve for his country, people, and family."

His latest plans on workers' rights' were bound to have some of the most intense kickback out of any of his policies so far, and so he decided to have a meeting with Mr. Robert McCgider, the Vice Executive Officer, in order to smooth things over. As he walked up to the man's offices he couldn't help but sweat a little. As he entered the office, McCgider seemed to be rather cross as he sat down opposite of his desk. The two men shook hands, and much to Sinclair's dread, McCgider began the conversation first. \"Governor, thanks for coming down here to discuss this brand new policy your party has been cooking up, though I'm sure as you and I both know it's not going to be very condusive to our company.\", McCgider said with a very obvious bout of annoyance and poor expectation for what was coming. Sinclair, though normally not one for confrontation, felt irritated at the prim arrogant executive who sat accross him. All the rightous anger that led him to write and then speak filled him until he soon had a confidence to match Mr. McCgider. \"I see we're skipping the pleasentries Mr. McCgider, so right to bussiness then. I came down here today to inform you that a bill is soon going to be passed. A very incredible bill that I was personally on the drafting commitee for and has unamious support within my party, which has a majority in both houses of legislature. The bill in question will give workers, especially railroad workers, such things as an 8 hour workday, paid vacation, the unquestioned right to form a union, and much to my personal delight, a mandate that each worker must be given atleast one share in the company in which he is employed. I came down here this fine afternoon to inform you of this so your company can make the necessary adjustments to conform to this new piece of legislation. If you have no further questions, I'll be leaving then.\" McCgider could hardly believe what he had just heard. He knew he was not going to enjoy this meeting, but the Governor had stunned him with the sheer radicalness of the plan. The numbers of such regulation reeling in his head, he soon locked eyes with Sinclair, \"No.\" he said. \"I do not Governor.\" \"Alright then. Have a good day then.\""

Got to meet with the Governor today.\" This was a bad sign. Kathlein knew that Robert had no love of Upton Sinclair, and him personally going down to his office meant that it was to inform him of a new policy, something that, knowing the Governor's rhetoric and record, was sure not to go over well with her spouse. \"And how was that?\" Robert, now pouring himself a glass of Scotch, took a big sigh. \"About as well as you could expect. Man's got a penchent for proposing big things, and today was none the different. A mandatory eight hour workday, mandatory worker owned shares, mandatory paid vacation time, soon they're bill mandatory daily picnics and mandatory worker sporting clubs. We're set to lose big, today I got screamed at for such a blunder, \"Negotiate!\" they said after I broke the news. Negotiate what? The man was absolutely hellbent on this new thing he's doing, I could see it in his eyes honey, he was going to have his way no matter what, and I don't want our company to be remembered the next time there's an inspection sweep going around. I'm sure that we can get by it, but I'm old enough already and I don't want this company to go belly up because of this, you know?\" Kathlein soon felt much better. Things had been rough for her baby, and he was just a little peeved, nothing a good deal of love and care couldn't fix in him.

Not only this will mean a totally different direction of the Spiritual Realm, and it will mean different foreign policy alignements. Bodin wonders in his latest letter, writing slowly with a shaky hand, wondering if he should return to writing science fiction and books on spiritual matters, or maintain the center of the Spiritualist movement and keep out every other faction from dominance, allowing a balanced government and political system.

The factions which most expect to succeed Bodin's government are the Dianetic Research Foundation's ministry, led by L. Ron Hubbard, which seek to orient the nation into a \"filter\" system, where the most devoted to Dianetics are given further information of its beliefs. This system of course ends in a somewhat oligarchic government, however it promises to maintain the corporatist economics that Bodin and his associates have managed. Aside from everything, L. Ron Hubbard is massively influential and has been considered Bodin's pupil, meaning his chance of being nominated Bodin's successor is the most likely case. However - there are multiple factions which have gained Bodin's favor through favors, money, intimidation, agreements, or all of the above: The Unarius Academy of Science has sought to largely influence Bodin's cabinet and Bodin himself through their ideas of reincarnation and past life regression. Their ostensible status as a \"scientific academy\" means that they've received much political power, especially due to their longtime heardquartering in El Cajon, Southern California, being one of the most ardent supporters of Bodin's government. Finally, a few other choices remain, being Jack Parsons and his clique of magick eccentrics, who have been briefly associated with Thelema or have been associated with Theosophy and other older religious movements. Their economics is left largely ambiguous, but it can be expected it will not be utilitarian in mindset, and instead will seek to fund spiritual matters even more than Bodin's America already had.\n\nThe black sheep of these factions, however is an emerging new religious movement led by a mysterious Krishna Venta, who operates out of Los Angeles. The movement, called Fountain of the World, is centered around Krishna, who claims to be Christ - and not only this, but that he was born on another, far away planet named Neophrates, which was Humanity's first home. Soon becoming uninhabitable as it reached closer and closer to the Sun, rocketships flew out of the planet holding tens of thousands of people - and most importantly, it was led by the spirit which now occupies Krishna's body, who presented revelations to multiple important religious figures across the World. Krishna has finalized most of his vision of History in writing, and in large crowded events. Despite the serious distinctfulness of Krishna's new religious movement, it also has large Theosophy and LDS Church influences in it's perspectives on spiritual and cosmic matters. Nonetheless, what matters at the end is who Ed Bodin, the reincarnation of Jean Bodin and the Spiritual Leader of America, who will remain respected like a new Washington for the remainder of his physical life in this planet, chose to succeed him.

CAL_disbandspiritualistparty_desc:0 "The Spiritualist Party is bar none the worst affront to Californian freedom out of any of the extremists that have run amuck in our streets. We must take decisive action against these troublemakers if we want to have any hope of keeping things safe for the citizens of our state.

CAL_exilesinclair_desc:0 "Sinclair, Sinclair. Once a left leaning Democrat, so long ago has drifted into the murky waters of the radicalism and sedition. Though his popularity remains great in these lands, we cannot allow him to spread his deadly and seditious message. Thus, we are going to politely ask him to leave this troubled land for another, where he can stir up the masses to agitate for such preposterous notions as ending inequality and poverty."

Luckily as good descendants of the American Republican Tradition, we respect the importance of the First Amendment and the Freedom to Worship. By securing this principal in our lands, hopefully the maligned peoples of Utah will see to reason and abandon the silly notion of Deseret when the greater project of America remains to be re-built."

CAL_anotherelection_desc:0 "Now that the radicals have been sorted out, addressing our coalition's elephant in the corner is unavoidable. The Republican, and interestingly enough, Revived Democrat Parties have gone back to sparring about as if nothing has changed. While a nuisance, the competition of parties is necessary for any Democracy to properly function. As such, we shall hold elections at once to determine which of these new parties is favored by the people of California."
CAL_democratvictory:0 "부흥민주당의 승리"
CAL_democratvictory_desc:0 "To the surprise of most, the Democratic Party, long thought dead entirely on the national political scene ever since the ill-fated presidency of Woodrow Wilson, has come out on top and now reins in California. While many reformists hoped that the Progressive tendencies expressed by the Roosevelts might come back to dwell in the Golden State, the recent speech by chairman Frank Olson has led many to doubt the possible of such aa resurgence. Staunchly agrarian and, in his own words, 'traditionally minded on social issues', these dreams have quickly been dashed."

Now that we're in control, it's time to change that.

We say no more! We've drafted some new tariffs to stick it to them, and generate some much-needed revenue for our massively underfunded state budget in the process. The farmers will be none too pleased with the expected retaliation tariffs on their produce, but they'll have to make sacrifices if they don't want to be competing with Russian peasants living in slave conditions."

The radicals in San Francisco might talk all they want about 'equality' and 'fair treatment', but we know for certain that they'd leave as soon as they might have to sent their children to school with those they profess to love. We cannot let this encroachment on our American continue; with our government totally free from the influence of New England hypocrites, the time has come to make it clear that California belongs to the white man."

We are very aware that there are many, especially in that foolish 'Republic of Jefferson' who would want to have their own states within the state. This subdivision is obviously unacceptable, and while we'll certainly not embrace tyranny, we'll keep firm control over decisions about the devolution of power to local and municipal governments. "

CAL_protecttheelectoralcollege_desc:0 "There are some saying that we should, as a state, keep the state system of direct elections. This is pure radical thinking, an idea advanced by fools wishing to do away with the safeguards our Founding Fathers created to confound them. For the time being, we are an independent country, and we should act like one. We will retain the electoral college, adapting this time-tested system to our present situation. Each county shall be granted some number of electors; a fixed number to each, and an additional allotment based on population. This will protect the whole of our state from being commanded by the whims of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and go a long way to satisfying those who still wish for an independent or autonomous state of Jefferson."
