#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
KAV_DESC_MENU:0 "대전쟁의 끝에서 벌어진 러시아에서의 분란 직후 캅카스는 내전으로 찢겨나갔습니다. 대부분의 지역들은 군주주의자들이나 공화주의자, 혹은 일부 민족주의 집단들의 편으로 갈라졌습니다. 하지만, 조지아의 산맥은 특별했습니다. 정치적 혼돈과 혼란이 수년 간 캅카스를 집어삼켰지만, until the political scene was unified by one Vladimir Mayakovsky, who enacted a program of creating an entirely new political system for Georgia based on Fiume. 이제 조지아는 범캅카스적 야망을 품은 캅카스회로 그 이름을 바꾸었습니다. 그러나, 캅카스회가 미래주의의 꿈을 이룰 수 있는가는 아직 지켜볼 일입니다."

kav.1.t:0 "1936년 시가 결투"
kav.1.desc:0 "The stadium was packed this evening as the hot, humid air of the early evening was as if charged electrically. Citizens from all over the country had amassed to join the spectacle of that was ahead to follow in the midst of concrete pit podium in the center. Festivities filled with presentations of experimental music pieces, poetry and performance art across the country had be leading towards this decisive moment in the history of Kavkazia. Once again it was time for the poetic duel to go ahead to decide the leader of the our society by meritocratic principles alone. With the first round being rather uneventful as contestants were expectedly holding back upon their literary capabilities for the sake of tension. Words of beautiful visions imagined for the future of their society were proclaimed with a thundering furor of passion. The goal was at hand, held deep within the nation hidden beyond the rubble of old that must be swept aside for the rich soil to appear and give life to blooming prosperity! With performances spanning multiple hours on average without interruption it was nothing less than exhausting to collapse. Barely holding onto their speech it was clear that intonation and mimic expression were regarded to their most articulate expressive detail. It had become clear that the former head of state Mayakovsky would stand in direct competition to the novelist Tolstoy and the poet colleague Khlebnikov. Initially nobody would have expected such a fierce nip-and-tuck race, but the circumstances proved everyone involved completely wrong. With words reflecting off the walls like daggers aimed at the hearts of their opponents the triad fought for the honorable leadership."
kav.1.a:0 "흘레브니코프가 tips the balance with verbal sorcery."
kav.1.b:0 "마야콥스키가 다시금 proves his mettle."
kav.1.c:0 "톨스토이가 산문을 막강한 무기처럼 휘두르다."

kav.2.t:0 "유일 공식어로서의 러시아어 승인"
kav.2.desc:0 "The Russian language holds an irreplaceable spot in every Kavkaz citizen's heart. It is the soul of every single work we have created so far, of our people and lastly our soil itself. If one could ever imagine to rid us of this fundamental right it was as if tearing our soul straight from the body. History itself has meanwhile proven, that those who shape the language for the benefit of their people also are able to guide them towards greatness. We will find this greatness in our tongue. Russian is a strong, passionate language as they say one has to experience its “dusha” (душа) the soul itself. We have to keep that in mind when considering to introduce any other language to the realm itself next to it. Onto these foundations we have to put down the thesis that only Russian should be considered to be the official language of the Kavkaz society. If we were to allow other minuscule languages we would tear our nation apart along the lines of barriers built by linguistic differences alone. This would mean suicide on a countdown for us and must be avoided vigilantly. Allowing everyone to speak their languages, even accents would mean allowing people to put themselves above the mass that defines our population. Every single unifying factor the Kavkazians have defined through their actions alone would be made undone by egoistic usage of speech. We hereby institute that the us and the Russian language are inseparable. We will ban any minority language, scrap their teaching in our school system and criminalize the public usage. These measures could be described as tyrannic by the locals, but they have yet to grasp the importance of language. Maybe they could regard this as their first lesson on their glorious path towards rebirth as full citizens."
kav.2.a:0 "수업을 시작하지."

kav.3.t:0 "유일 공식어로서의 조지아어 승인"
kav.3.desc:0 "It is wrong to proclaim that we are defined by our homogeneity as our society flourishes upon its diverse influence. We have to admit that the Caucasian lands and the Georgians in particular have shaped this country to a considerable amount. Are we really going to be hypocrites and claim that all that was done could be accomplished in the name of Slavdom? Absolutely not! We will not do it as the reactionaries did when they pushed into the Caucasus, having the locals at their mercy much like a pillaging conqueror. We will hold out our arms openly to welcome our people into their home, knowing that beyond the skin we are nothing but the same. Meanwhile we know that to guard the existence of this right must be upheld sacrosanct as we bind our own existence to theirs. Establishing Georgian as the second official language of our nation we are going to proclaim an era of change in our policies. We do not have to work towards assimilation at every cost for the sake of greatness if it is going to instead alienate people and rob them of their history, their soul. Much like the Slavic spirit is ancient so is the Georgian kind and we have to acknowledge. In order to reconcile our people schools should promote the studying of the Georgian language and cultural contents as we preserve these traditions to be built upon in the future. The Kavkaz society should be able to build a bridge between the different parts of its population so that we can thrive from our plurality."
kav.3.a:0 "그리하여 캅카스에서 우리 사회는, 그리하여 그 언어는 나왔구나."

kav.4.t:0 "신 캅카스 Curriculum"
kav.4.desc:0 "The Caucasian lands have always been historically regarded as intellectual backwater with lack of road network, language and tribal barriers making it very hard to even achieve a secondary education. If we want to shape a future worthy of the men who are destined to shape this society into a higher state of being we need to invest heavily in the modernization of our school system. First off we should begin by promoting a more progressive curriculum itself suited the ideological needs of our nation. The battle we are fighting right now begins in the heads of our people, if we do not act accordingly we will lose it. Literature must be the focus of whatever choice we may pick as we can best be described as a country founded by writers and intellectuals."
kav.4.a:0 "The Curriculum itself is a feat of literary prowess."

kav.5.desc:0 "Language is in itself nothing more than an archaic product of the times, shaped merely by a clique of traditionalists to be molded into their ideal shape. This in itself reflects just how rotten this ancient construct is: People will always do anything in their might to keep their words reflect opinions that they seek out. Isn't the one who has the pen in hand the one who truly decides the future of the people? Thought out to replace this tyranny of words is the language of Zaum brought together by Velimir Khlebnikov and his colleague Aleksei Kruchenykh. It is the anti-thesis to anything our current standards confine us to as it is freeing us of the shackles that bind our tongue and expand it beyond the common rationality of man. Brought forward first as lyrical experiment Zaum schools expanded through the realms of the Kavkaz society with intellectuals voicing their explicit support for it's spread through literature. Standing at the crossroads to define the character of our nation we seek to steer towards the beauty of sound symbolism as we must restore our ancient Slavic tongue through the experience of poetic beauty alone. Furthermore our people have to be made aware of the changes introduced as public gatherings, even festivals must be held to celebrate the beauty of the zaumic tongue. Nothing but organic is the creation of words for we abolish the confining boundaries of the old books for good. Our language has to live by the standards defined by Mayakovsky's prophetic words alone "We have to glorify life, it is demanded by the existence of our nation." And so much like the ancient tower of Babel send a wave of words upon the tongues of every person across the cradle of civilization we have built a monument in Zaum itself."

kav.6.desc:0 "Language is a concept that is hard to grasp to any regular human being at it's fullest capabilities for we have learned to speak without thinking at times. Words are meaningless at times, spoken with a propagandist motive in mind to be drilled into the minds of people for the sake of their fellowship. We must learn to use this might accordingly as it is often overseen in its influence as we aspire to be a society far beyond the regular scope of our times. With Khlebnikov fully aware of the power being held by word alone we are in the process of creating a concept language. "Zaum" (roughly translating to "transreason", "transration" or "beyonsense"), a word itself constructed by the Russian prefix за (za) meaning "beyond, behind" and the noun ум (um) describing "the mind, intellect", is the term we assign our new language. With our goals in mind we desire nothing less than the expansion of our literary sphere to enable us to communicate our ideals to the fullest potential. Man must be able to express himself to the fullest expression without having forced upon the yoke of an artificial construct! Surely it will mean a lot of work to completely define a language and even more to convince the people of our nation to use it, but we have to accomplish it for our sake. Hereby we set upon ourselves the destiny to create a meaningful tongue based on symbolism rather than dogma, to return to the ancient language given to us in primeval times. Khlebnikov meanwhile is working to found an academic branch revolving around his concept studies of linguistics merged with poetry to explore the phenomenon of sound further."

We must not fall behind on advancing our own ideas of ruling the oceans to guarantee our trade goods to pass through the Bosporus freely.How we go about it is entirely left to the minds of our admiralty with all theories being thrown around freely.Either we could fellow the ideals of a standing battle-fleet to scare our opponents with the might of our gigantic cannon boats alone. Make them fear our might so that they never dare to even come close to our shores!Another idea is more voiced by the more pragmatic wing of our young navy: Cripple their trading fleet, sink their transports! The wolf pack will go out for their furious hunt and strike fear into the heart of every sailor willing to enter our waters for he might not be ever able to leave…Lastly we could choose to directly attack their achilles heel and bomb their ports down to ashes. Our new carriers would set out to heroically rule the skies like eagles as they dive towards their floating prey.Whatever we make of these proposals is left to ourselves completely as our word marks the ultima ratio.

The latest point on the list concerned the airforce and it's strategic deployment. The Caucasian mountains are steep and hard to cross, so that the only way to truly be able to control the furthest reaches of our realm will be decided in part by effective control of the skies.Once again our officers are split on the matter as our current capabilities are calling for an absolute reform of aerial doctrine.The hardliners advocate the most radical changes in the form of embracing the doctrine of strategic destruction. Send long-range bombers right into the heart of the enemies territory, let them feel the wrath of our nation as kilotons of explosives rain upon the enemy like fiery raindrops sent as their biblical doomsday!More moderate elements propose using our airforce for battlefield support as cavalry from the skies. Our men may never be fearful as a guardian angel guides their steps from above, ready to call strike at the enemy in a heroic leap of faith for they dive towards the enemy.Lastly a more pragmatic wing of the officer staff emerged as an interest group promoting the usage tactical bombers. Why should we decide between the beauty of incendiary beauty falling like a metallic glitter from the heavens and supporting our men right the front?Naturally the atmosphere is quite tense. Our aircraft industry is still in its foundations and the call made has a detrimental impact upon our future industrial production."

He was obsessed with it; he looked at it like a machine that never ended, a machine that moved alongside the laws of Space-Time, those iron laws of great beauty that function beyond human rationality, like marching soldiers moving always forward, always forward, decaying whatever cannot keep up.\n\n Tick tock, tick tock, the clock goes. And so, one day at exactly 5:32 PM, Velimir got out of his seat after days of incessant clock-watching and moving things around on his room to the march of the clock, painting pictures according to the constant clock noise, hammering a table; he quickly gathered a multitude of people across Tiblis to proclaim to them something. Nobody knew for sure except for his closest aids. He grabbed a large clock and his watch on his pulse, and demanded the presence of an orchestra. Of course, being the leader of the country, he managed to gather a number of musicians to begin introducing whatever he wanted to bring. Of course, these strange and sudden pieces of performance art weren't uncommon, but for the Chairman to do it like this felt even stranger. He began breathing to the tick of the clock, opening the clock up and looking at it's internal mechanisms, fucntioning by the very existence of mystical laws of Space-Time, and so he demanded the orchestra to begin playing to the march of the clock, as he screamed; \"We shall bend time and yet march with it to the Future!\nCome with me, to the great State of Time which I proclaim today!\" Applause. Confusion. Marching. Marching to the tick of the clock, to the boots stamping the ground."
