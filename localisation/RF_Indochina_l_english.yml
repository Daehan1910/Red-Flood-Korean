dainam.99.desc:0 "France fell, and its most far-flung colonies suddenly found themselves alone and without any support from the French state. Governors fled, leaving the peninsula to fend for itself. 이에 일본은 인도차이나의 통제권을 제의했습니다. 한때 프랑스 치하에 있던 라오스인, 베트남인, 캄보디아인들은 안도의 숨을 내쉬었습니다. Finally, people like themselves, helping Indo-China become a true, modern state. 그리곤 일본 식민군이 들어왔습니다. They mocked them for their fumbling attempts at Japanese, for their smaller stature, for everything the Japanese deemed 'inferior' in the Indo-Chinese. 해방자라며 들어왔던 이들은 모욕스러운 조롱과도 같이, 곧 프랑스만큼이나 잔인한 이들임을 스스로 드러내보였습니다. And the Indo-Chinese started to foment rebellion, taking pride not in their own individual tribes, but in the nation of Indo-China, in the Cambodians and Vietnamese who stood alongside each other under each oppressor, and had stood strong. They took pride in the commonalities between their otherwise different peoples, and prepared to throw off the shackles of colonialism. 인도차이나의 수도이자 일본 식민행정부가 자리한 사이공은 is firmly in Japanese hands. Soldiers march up and down the streets of Saigon, through the many districts and suburbs of the. Gia Dinh, the industrial district, smells of coke and coal, smelting iron and burning charcoal. Tan Binh, a district intended to be the new headquarters of the administration, as the original beating heart of the city has grown too crowded, is full of aristocrats and old guard, determining the lives of thousands with quotas and laws. Thu Duc-Nha Be is full of Japanese ships, moving back and forth between the ports of the colony and mainland, where fishermen try to compete with vast nets, undercut at ever chance by their Japanese overlords. It is in these environments that rebellion is smoldering, ready to ignite."

dainam.100.desc:0 "Today, the Japanese Colonial Administration’s headquarters, a large building in central Saigon, was attacked. Hundreds of armed protestors and rioters, with everything ranging from simple bamboo polls to outdated (but still deadly) firearms. The Japanese soldiers, with their bolt-action arisakas, fought to the death, but the crowd seemed to grow. Every shot taken, two more Vietnamese would join the crowd. Every martyr bleeding on the street inspired dozens more to join.\n\nEven as the soldiers retreated into the building, locking doors and barricading themselves within the administrative building, they were followed. Rickshaws were filled with stones and pushed by straining crowds, smashing into doors and windows. Molotov cocktails prepared from old rice-wine bottles smashed against walls and chairs. \n\nInside, Lieutenant Imaeda Soseki prepared for the end. He and the twenty remaining guards accepted that today was the day they died. Shots of sake were poured. Bayonets were fixed. And Imaeda let out a long, haggard sigh.\n\n“Tenno heika banzai,” he whispered coldly. The soldiers around him repeated, louder. He rose his voice. “Tenno heika banzai!” He shouted. The soldiers around him repeated, louder. And soon, a harmony of twenty one men, ready to die, and die painfully, rose to a fever pitch. They charged the crowd that was now pouring through the embassy, screaming their warcry, only to be met by the louder, clearer, and more determined shouts of:\n\n “Dong Duong Mai Mai Truong Ton!”"
