#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_CUONG_DE_DESC:0 "A Pan-Asianist and a Republican Revolutionary in his youth, when he still fought for the Indochinese people’s right of self determination back in 1900s-1910s, he accepted the Japanese proposal regarding setting up a new, \"free\" regime in war-torn Annam after being \"liberated\" and was later officially granted his current position by the Japanese after the Great War. He was a suitable candidate, for one, he was a popular revolutionary prince, who also was a loyalist to the Pan-Asian vision of Emperor Taisho. Cuong De spent 10 years in Japan, studying the benefits of the Meiji Revolution to apply them to his homeland. However, the year is now 1936, and after 18 years of reign, although the now \"emperor\" Nam-Hùng (translated to \"The Great South\") proposed countless reforms and policies that would have benefited the people and perhaps even save the weak and barely functioning regime, the country is still de facto ran by the Japanese businessmen with their military and old French plantation owners. But his voice was unheard, as he holds no real power. And as the days are passing by, the people are starving and the brutal exploitation of the locals has ruined every good images of the Japanese, the majority of the people are slowly being influenced by revolutionaries and their radical ideas, which leads to them forming small groups and clubs in secret, with the sole mission of to get rid of Cuong-De and his Japanese \"friends\" once and for all. Cuong-De, however, is already aware of the ELF’s existence and activities and supports them, even going as far as to leak documents and other information about the horrible crimes committed by the Japanese in order to finally regain the well deserved freedom for his homeland and to redeem his name."
#IDEAS#
DAI_acolonialstate:0 "비겁한 지도층"
DAI_acolonialstate_desc:0 "Puppet \"Emperor\" Cuong De took the throne of Indochina in 1918 at the behest of the Japanese. He has since accepted every policy the Japanese have forced on him. Appeasing the Japanese has come at a price, starvation in the countryside and abuses in the Japanese concessions is rife. Cuong De is now known as nothing more than a coward by his people."
DAI_united:0 "끓어오르는 불만"
DAI_united_desc:0 "The Japanese were initially welcomed as \"Liberators\" from the French when they took over Indochina in 1919. However, in 16 years most policies implemented were only to the benefit of the Japanese - the occupation and Nihonisation of Saigon and Haiphong, ceding half of Cao-Miên and Ai-Lao to our rivals - only fueled the hatred and open rebellious acts against the current regime. Such rebellions have gone on to form Revolutionary and Nationalist parties, with the common goal of Freedom and Self determination for the peoples of Indochina."
DAI_nihonisation:0 "황민화"
DAI_nihonisation_desc:0 "The enlightened suzerainty of the Japanese has brought a great many changes to Annamu, not the least of which is a tide of Japanese investment and modern machinery. Moreover, Japanese immigrants arrive every month, bridging new skills and cultural conflict to both the cities and countryside farms of Indochina. While some racist detractors have derided this as a blatant attempt to relive population pressures in Japan, any Japanese diplomat can explain at length that this is a pure expression of Asian brotherhood. A brotherhood so valuable that the contribution of arts produced with new Japanese-sponsored industry for the common defense against Imperialism is a small price to pay."

dainam.99.desc:0 "대전쟁에서의 패배 직후 혼란 속에서 프랑스 정부는 안남을 능히 통제할 여력을 유지할 수 없게 되었습니다. A rising Japanese empire in the east, seeing the impending French debt situation caused by the mutually assured meat grinder that was the Western Front, offered to purchase the Indochinese colony. France, in its desperation, sold the colony for an undisclosed amount of money to the Empire of Japan. Almost immediately after the French withdrawal, the colony was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. According to Japanese reports, it was a liberation effort.\n\nIn 1918, the Treaty of Saigon was signed. It redrew the map of former French Indochina, establishing a Japanese-sponsored client state ruled by the Emperor [$Emperor_name] and ceding the city of Saigon to the Empire directly. In order to develop Saigon after destructive rebellions in 1917, the Japanese authorities offered contracts of servitude to the peasantry, who were heavily impoverished due to the chaos following the French defeat. Indochina’s population and economic stability. In return for being paid and given living quarters, Vietnamese peasants would be drawn into unhealthy working conditions under terms akin to slavery. While many have run the course of these contracts, they were only somewhat less desperately impoverished by the end of their indentures, leading to the formation of an urban slum in the edges of Saigon.\n\nSaigon was renamed to “Makitton” in 1925, and the city boomed in trade and wealth. Japanese immigration to Makitton skyrocketed, and the population of Japanese in Indochina has steadily increased for over a decade. New industrial sectors and modern living sectors slowly grown over the ruins and wreckage left by rebels in 1917.\n\nPlans for the controlled demolition of classical architecture were scrapped early, with the administration opted to preserve colonial French and Nguyen architecture while integrating their styles into the modern city center. Makitton, through prosperity born of forced industrialization and labour, has become known as the “Pearl of the Oriental”, a melting pot of French, Japanese, and native cultures.\n\nYesterday, the Japanese administration announced a three-year plan to prepare the city to be integrated as a prefecture to their ever expanding empire.Applauded in the city center, the proclamation has sent waves of discontent amongst the natives of Indochina rippling through the countryside. The Xac-Tex preempted any attempt at unseemly behavior within the city environs, but several demonstrations managed to gather in the surrounding countryside before being broken up."

These supplies will be placed under IJA’s command in their effort to \"civilize the barbaric Chinese and their disorganized warlords that plague the nation\".\n\nThe majority of our Japanese High Command and the natives approve of this request, as it will definitely improve professionalism in the army. Some officers even state that this action will promote a good image about our nation abroad, liberating unfortunate nations, such as we were liberated years ago. The voting is still underway, but based on several reports, it will likely be in favor of the Japanese."
