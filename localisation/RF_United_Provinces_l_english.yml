#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
UPI_DESC_MENU:0 "대전쟁이 끝난 직후 , the British hold India slipped away. As the collapse of the Raj started to build momentum and get worse and worse, Winston Churchill (who was moved to the region following the military fiasco that was the Gallipoli campaign) carved out his personal fiefdom from the ruins of the Raj, swearing to unify the continent under British rule. His policies have not been kind to the native Indian population, with hundreds of thousands dead following crackdowns on movements for majority rule. As the regime becomes less and less popular, a decision will need to be made on the path that the United Provinces will take."
UPI_brutal_colonizer:0 "잔혹한 식민주의자"
UPI_brutal_colonizer_desc:0 "한 명의 시위자를 보느니 12명의 시체를 보는 게 낫다는 잔혹한 사내, 그것이, 대화 대신 폭력으로 연합주의 반란들을 진압하겠다는 윈스턴 처칠의 특기입니다."

UPI_winston_churchill:0 "사내는 아무 이익도 없이 ANZAC 병사들만 총열 앞에 쓰러뜨린 갈리폴리에서의 도살의 책임자입니다. 중동에서의 화학병기 사용의 배후였던 폭군이며, 마을을 통째로 사라지게 만든 인도의 독재자이니, 하루도 손에서 피가 마르지 않는 무너진 사내, 윈스턴 처칠입니다. 불쌍한 윈스턴에게 또 무슨 일이 벌어질까요? 주변을 둘러싼 번뜩이는 단도를 보지 않으려, 사내는 정신을 멍하게 해줄 위스키로써만 수평선을 향해 내달리고 있습니다."

UPI_avatar_desc:0 "누구도 이 담대하며 감화력 넘치는 여인이 어디서 온 건지 알지 못 합니다. 여인은 찬양하러, 고함치러, 인도인들에게 신성한 진리를 우연히 깨달았다 말해주기 위해 찾아왔습니다. 시간이 흐르며, 아수라, 사이비종교, 이념, 개인숭배의 전적이 된 완전한 이 난장판 끝에, 수많은 사람들은 그저 붙들고 있을 어떤 희망의 선언이 필요해졌습니다. 이 공포의, 분노의, 혐오의 착취가 잘못 기억되고 노골적인 거짓말로 치장된 신학 속 정당화의 허식과 결합하여, 세계를 피 속에 잠기게 할 한 여신이 이끄는 화신 숭배로 이어졌습니다."

UPI_brutal_putdowns_desc:0 "잔혹하며 정기적인 우리 군에 의한 진압의 결과, 인민은 우리 정부에 어떤 믿음도 갖지 않게 되었습니다. 무력을 통해 누가 그들을 지배하는가를 일깨워 줄 것입니다."
UPI_shadow_gallipoli:0 "갈리폴리의 그림자"
UPI_shadow_gallipoli_desc:0 "육군에 입대한 이들 사이에서조차 갈리폴리에서의 실패의 그림자는 자신감에 달라붙어 있습니다. 처칠이 분명 최고의 지도자가 아니라는 태도는 부사관들과 폐하의 장교진에게도 마찬가지로 스며들었습니다."
UPI_alone_unsupplied_cutoff:0 "홀로, 보급도 없이 단절된 채"
UPI_alone_unsupplied_cutoff_desc:0 "내부제조에 점점 더 의존하게 되면서, 우리 병사들이 사용하던 고품질의 리-엔필드들은 점차 자체제작 총기로 바뀌어갔습니다. 제조 문제를 제쳐두더라도, 총기는 우리가 필요한 만큼 널려 있지 않습니다."

UPI_freedom_assembly:0 "집회의 자유"
UPI_freedom_assembly_desc:0 "모두는 사상의 시장에서 각자의 관념에 대해 논할 수 있어야 합니다. 최고만이 정상에 설 것이고 나머지는 버려질 것입니다. 지도자에게 무시당하지 않는 한 사람들이 폭력과 혁명에 자연스레 끌리진 않습니다. 우린 인민을 무시하지 않을 것입니다."

KAL_himsa:0 "Himsa"
KAL_himsa_desc:0 "Himsa is the true embodiment of Kali, of destruction and hurt and suffering that so marks this era of Kali Yuga. Unlike the heretical Ahimsa, which suggests we extend this time of suffering by not bringing harm to others, Himsa declares that harm is the way to accelerate forth, to go forth, to bring about reality anew.

UPI.1.t:0 "첫 번째 편지"
UPI.1.desc:0 "“Dearest Lord of the Admiralty, Duke Winston Churchill, \n\n I hope this letter finds you in ill health. Because of your choices in the battles of Gallipoli, I have lost three children. Joshua, Frank, and Harvey lay not in their beds, warm and safe, but under the dunes of the Turkish lands, because of you. I understand that war will result in death, and when my boys went to war, I was perhaps naïve in believing that they would all return safe. But as more details of the blunders that lead to their demises emerged, as your buffoonery and incompetence became more clear, I realize now that they would be a thousand times better in Ypres or the Somme than under your command in the Dardanelles. \n\n I know now that their fates were preventable, if only they had been sent to East Africa, against the Askari, or if they had found themselves knee-deep in the mud of France. How pitiful, that I wish for them to have suffered so, for otherwise they would not have died. Perhaps they could have done many great things. I know that Harvey always enjoyed cooking – perhaps he was his company’s in-field chef before the shells fell. Perhaps there are poems, lost in those dunes, that my Joshua wrote. I won’t know, now. May you never again sleep peacefully, for I have not. \n\n Yours, Mary Williamson” \n\n Dated January 3rd, 1920. Churchill took another long swig of whiskey, and tried to fold it up, throw it into the fire, as he had some few other letters of its type. And yet, he could not."
UPI.1.a:0 "Are the smudges from her tears, or his? He does not remember."

UPI.2.t:0 "두 번째 편지"
UPI.2.desc:0 "“It has become apparent that, due to the shortcomings in strategy and a lack of results, that Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admiralty, is deeply incompetent. After repeated mistakes in the assaults on the Dardanelles, including the complete misjudging of the situation regarding mines, the safety of the soldiers to land, and the lack of artillery support provided, despite no less than five battleships being within firing range, resulting in nearly a hundred-thousand casualties within the first four days  of landing, the only course that can be reasonably seen that Churchill is a liability in this role.” \n\n Attached to the back, was the official letter, telling Winston in plain terms that there was little more that could be said, and that the King has officially revoked his role as Lord of the Admiralty. This, he thought, was a memento mori. Not for himself, no. The skull on his table, its phrenological markings a newer addition to the dusty thing, was reminder enough of looming death. This was the death-memory of a career, a career which flung itself into wild adventures it was not ready for. He would never, never, repeat the mistake of Gallipoli, never again send men into the fray without deep, careful consideration. \n\n Assuming he could actually get out of this damned place."
UPI.2.a:0 "He hasn’t smelled the salt of the sea, or even the stink of fish, in years. He’s almost forgotten the coast."

UPI.3.t:0 "세 번째 편지"
UPI.3.desc:0 "“Lord Winston Churchill, \n\n With regards to your placement within the government of Britain, a question we have received three separate times (not to mention the letters which have been thrown away – sending us fifteen letters will not make the post office faster, Winston!) it has been decided that you are not a total persona non grata. Instead, you shall be given a place in the colonies of the British Empire. You may, if you wish, accept a position in the British Raj, as the governor of the province of Lucknow.” \n\n The rest of the letter wasn’t terribly important. It was, however, everything to Churchill. Looking at it all, looking at where his life went. Accepting a role in India. After Kurdistan. After Gallipoli. After so much death, destruction, and horror wrought in the name of the British Empire, it was still willing to use him somewhere. Perhaps that was a good sign, or perhaps they understood the impending collapse of the Raj, and hoped he would die in the ensuing fights. \n\n But he had kept a stiff upper lip, and survived. And he would keep doing so."
UPI.3.a:0 "Blood, blood, everywhere. Every drop stains his mind, until he is red as a Cardinal and as dour as any butcher."

UPI.4.t:0 "A Concerned Maid"
UPI.4.desc:0 "“Sir,” a maid of Indian blood entered his room with his morning tea and whiskey-soda. Where, once, it was called ‘mouthwash’ for its tiny amount of whiskey, it was now as much whiskey as it was soda. Some days, he just wanted it undiluted. \n\n “Enter,” mumbled Churchill. “Leave it by the bed,” he gestured to his side, where he had scarcely woken up before having his breakfast. Of the few perks this post had, getting breakfast in bed was an undeniable one. He picked up the crystal glass, swirled it around, pretending to care about taste and smell before gulping down the drink. The maid watched, her mouth agape in horror at the wreck of a man before her. \n\n “Well? Do you have something to say?” He growled, noticing her worry. \n\n “Well, sir, I don’t mean to be rude…” He waited. She waited. The air felt tight. Like before a battle, before the first shot was fired. “But the maids and I…have wondered if you could…ease back on the alcohol? It can’t be heal—” \n\n A solid half-pound of crystal glass smashed into her eye. She let out a scream, blood streaming from her split eyelash. She curled up against the wall, trying to fight tears, while Churchill roared at her like a hell-beast unleashed."

UPI.5.t:0 "A Concerned Soldier"
UPI.5.desc:0 "“Sir!” He was saluted as he walked through his library once more. He turned to the soldier, a young Englishman, no more than twenty. Good, solid stock, broad-shouldered and large-chested, the kind of person he knew could be counted on to do the right thing when the natives got rowdy. His Enfield-Martini, one of the better rifles someone could get in this god-forsaken, sun-blasted hell, was clean and well-maintained. A model soldier. Churchill gave a half-hearted salute back. \n\n “I must remind you, sir, as you requested me to, that there will be a military parade in the courtyard. And while my place is not to judge nor command, sir, I must insist on behalf of Colonel Randal that you attend – sun would do you good, he said. Sir.” \n\n Churchill paused for a moment, looking over the guard. Frowning, he asked the man for his name. \n\n “Sir, I am Private George Statham.” \n\n “A private? Let me tell you, young man, that you are never to speak to me of such matters again,” he spat. \n\n “Sir, I am merely—” \n\n “Yes, I know, you’re following orders. Let me give you new ones – get your pale, unbloodied ass out on to the streets of Lucknow for a day. Then you’ll know why I don’t go outside.

The old Viceroy was baffled. He was sure that he went to the library for something but he couldn’t remember what it was. Maybe he just went to grab a book? Some of the old wisdom from Smith would be useful to put the Raj back on track. Maybe some of the classics from Shakespeare could be helpful to alleviate his insomnia. Maybe he just went for to drink a whisky on his comfy chair? Well, he could drink, and had drank on every chair the house. \n\n Or maybe he just went to take a look at the reports over his table since he had nothing to do. Anything was possible at that point. \n\n “I think I should go to bed” decided Churchill. The loud noises of his slippers on the carpet from his heavy feet filled him with a feeling of ennui. He felt like each one of his 61 years was coming to him with every step. The old man wished to recover that enthusiasm he had when he proposed that foolish Gallipoli operation. Even the most resonating of failures would fill him of more life than his current depressing situation."

Four, if you count ‘shoving a gun down my throat and pulling the trigger.’ But as that is off the table, three it is. \n\n First, he can go forwards as he had before, attempt to contact Britain. It will require just a little bit of shoving people out of the way, but it is entirely possible. He could do it. Just…get past those socialist warlords in Bihar, and taste the salt of the sea once more. Yes, yes he could do that. He could do that. \n\n Next, he could double down. Become worse. If the Indians are already putting up posters declaring his monsterhood, then he could very well become a monster. Order, at all costs. Order, in all times. Reunite the provinces of India, form a new Raj, one that could last a thousand years, as long as Britain, until every trace of this disgusting continent is gone, and all that is left is a Britain he loves. \n\n Or…or he could be a politician again. The warlord life never suited him. No, he loves democracy too much, he loves freedom too much, to think about being a warlord. Introduce reforms, install a new electoral system. If he will create a new Raj, it will be through peace. If he creates a new Raj, it could be with words, not weapons. \n\n But which way forwards? Which way?"

Fear and panic shot through her as she raced to find some way to explain to Sir Churchill that there simply wasn’t any wine left. What happened, where did it go? She could have sworn there was a new shipment in last week, but then Churchill had held that party with his officers. Did he drink it all already? Did some sly officer steal it? \n\n She ventured back upstairs, shaking as she approached Sir Churchill. \n\n “S-sir, there is no more wine.” \n\n There was silence, tense silence, as Churchill contemplated this. \n\n He slammed his fist down on to the table, and told her to get out, shouted to be left alone. She didn’t need much convincing, soon running to her quarters."

UPI.37.t:0 "Meeting the Officers"
UPI.37.desc:0 "“You are all doing a wonderful job,” Churchill said to the officers gathered before him, before ordering three more bottles of wine to be brought over. Of the twenty men, his closest friends and companions in this trying time, fifteen were piss-drunk, two were sober, two were only mildly buzzed, and one was passed out on the table, a puddle of spittle slowly growing from the cavernous source that was his mouth. \n\n “I have read all your reports, of course,” Churchill lied. “And I have come to the conclusion that we are making progress. While there have been some setbacks in the pacification efforts, it really is quite wonderful to see the progress we have made in Lucknow proper. I greenlight all your proposals.” \n\n This was problematic, given half of them didn’t remember their proposals, and the other half of them contradicted each other. But the officers weren’t drunk to celebrate. They were drunk to tolerate their monthly meeting with Churchill. To an extent, Churchill knew this. But he didnt’ care - the officers knew how to work among themselves, to work towards Churchill. It didn’t matter how productive the meetings were, they were formalities. The officers really ran the show, and Churchill thought that suited him just fine."

UPI.38.t:0 "Food Shortages"
UPI.38.desc:0 "The farmers of the United Provinces have been a constant source of pain and agony for the regime. Not only do they not produce as much as they’re instructed to, but what they do produce is often stashed and hidden away. No matter how many police are brought in, no matter how grandiose the threats of violence are, and no matter how harshly those threats are enacted, the Lucknow police and Churchill’s army cannot dislodge the rice from the farmers. Promises of payment don’t work - the farmers have been burned before. Threats of violence don’t work - it’s not like the farmers would be free from harm if they handed the crops over. It’s a problem many in the regime believe insurmountable. This has had many, many, consequences, chief among them that famine perpetually looms over the United Provinces. Unless something changes soon, the people of Lucknow will starve."
UPI.38.a:0 "We still have enough rice, right?"

UPI.39.t:0 "Food Riots"
UPI.39.desc:0 "“We need food!” Was the simple, constant, chant of desperate people. It filled the streets of Lucknow, it filled the throats of the population when rice did not. As the rationing was imposed, a mere handful of rice was what they were expected to eat each day, barely enough to sustain an invalid, a prisoner who never moves, let alone people who work every day. Children were sickly, the elderly were already half-starved, the hunger gnawed at the entire city. If there wasn’t relief soon, then the riot would become a full on revolution. The Officers of the United Provinces watched over them all, trying to decide their course of action."
UPI.39.a:0 "Damn it all."

UPI.40.t:0 "Shoot the Starving"
UPI.40.desc:0 "“Form rank!” Shouted the officer, raising his sword in the air. The three rows of soldiers organized themselves. The first row took aim before the command was even given. The protestors weren’t in full riot, in fact, many of them were standing arm-in-arm with each other, silent, not moving forwards. They were daring the soldiers to shoot. \n\n There wasn’t much left for them to lose - when their relatives had been disappeared, when their families had been held under the yoke of oppression, never knowing when they’d be targeted for sedation, for counter-regime activities, for merely being too rich-looking for some Anglo-Indian’s taste. If they died, then they would die proving to all India that Churchill was not a friend to India, was a man to be resisted at all costs, as they were doing here and now."

UPI.41.t:0 "Beat the Starving"
UPI.41.desc:0 "“Disperse!” Shouting the officer, waving his nightstick in the air. “Under orders of the Viceroy Churchill, you are all to disperse!” \n\n No one listened to him, no one dispersed and slunk back to their homes with tails between their legs. No one was willing to give up the fight, not now, not when home meant death by slow, agonizing starvation. The officers felt, as the masses of Indians, many thin from lack of food, others wild-eyed with desperation, pangs of fear, guilt, desperation just the same as the Indians they were told to kep under control. \n\n But their duty was their duty. When they did not disperse, the crowd was forced away. Squads of police and army-men, with clubs and nightsticks, beat away the protestors, breaking bones and shattering skulls. At the end of the day, seventy-five of the rioters, whose sole desire was to have a day’s worth of rice, lay dead, and hundreds more crawled back home to bleed."

He hated the last one most of all. Reminded him too much of being awake, without the ability to drink to soften the blows. But today was a lazy day, a lazy day like any other lazy sunday. Nothing to worry about, nothing to concern himself with, the one day he would declare was solely for him, and him alone. A critic could charge that it wasn’t exactly much different from every other day, but Churchill had long ago purged the critics, moving them to low-level positions where he wouldn’t be bothered by them."

UPI.43.desc:0 "Knock, knock, knock. \n\n Winston tumbled off his sofa, trying to stand upright and proper as he went to the door. \n\n Knock, knock, knock. \n\n This had better be important, Churchill thought to himself as he grasped the doorknob. \n\n Knock, knock, knock! \n\n He swung open the door. An officer, no, a field marshal, field marshal Dyer, was standing there, his face covered in sweat and his expression transfixed in fear. \n\n “Sir,” he said. “It’s urgent.”"

UPI.44.t:0 "With Far Less Casualities"
UPI.44.desc:0 "“The solution,” Churchill barked, “is simple. We’ve done it before, we can do it again. Get the gas out, get the gas out and shell the villages until the villages get these upstart ring-leaders to stop! If that doesn’t work, beat the hell out of any Indian who looks at you funny. This isn’t a difficult thing to sort out.” \n\n The officers, not wanting to contradict Churchill, perhaps out of a misplaced loyalty to him or perhaps because they were too tired to argue, nodded. \n\n “Gas will quell any uprising with far less casualties than any other method. You all know this. So why have you not gone and done it yet!” \n\n One by one, the men left, wringing their hands with uncertainty towards their orders."

UPI.45.t:0 "Urgent Meeting"
UPI.45.desc:0 "“We don’t have the resources, we don’t have the means to obtain resources, and we don’t have the loyalty of the people to secure the means,” Churchill said grimly. “We are, simply put, stuck in a deep hole with no way to get out. No way, except through grit, determination, and plans that I am drafting with some very close advisors of mine.” The field marshals looked at each other, wondering who could be closer to Churchill than them, save perhaps the whiskey bottle. \n\n “I expect your men to be in top shape, to be ready to fight more than starved Indians.” \n\n With that ominous message, Churchill left."

UPI.46.t:0 "Drills"
UPI.46.desc:0 "“Load, aim, fire!” Shouted the drill-master, treating everyone in the squad as if they had the same gun - namely, the worst gun of the lot. One of the soldiers was lucky enough to have a Lee-Enfield, but he wasn’t allowed to load the magazine. Instead, he needed to load each bullet, one at a time, before shooting, to keep pace with his fellows. He felt stifled, like he had been lead astray by the man who sold him the Lee. Of course, if he was unfortunate, then say nothing of Charles, the poor bastard, whose reproduction Martini-Henry that he got ‘for real cheap’ exploded in his face. \n\n The drills had gone successfully though. The group of ten men had been able to, before they were reduced to nine, average twelve shots in sixty seconds. Not awful, but not great either. Much better than before, though, their average of 6 shots in the same amount of time. Accuracy was going up, too. They were becoming a fighting force, no doubt about it. \n\n The artillery corps still unnerved the soldier, though. They were always firing, never quiet, and the place they were in had started to smell quite a bit like a pool back home. Whatever were the leaders planning?"

UPI.47.t:0 "The Old Dog's Got His Bite Back!"
UPI.47.desc:0 "“Bihar, gentlemen,” Churchill said. “Bihar’s warlords have ownership of a sea route. They have ownership of resources, food, guns, factories, we can use. They aren’t close to the Madras presidency, which is good.” \n\n “Why, sir? Wouldn’t it be easier to plunge through the south and connect with the Madras presidency?” \n\n “No. The last thing I want is a British soldier dead by my hand. We go through Bihar, and we will make certain that the Madras presidency will not come into conflict with us through mistaken identity.” He spoke with a candor that hadn’t been seen in Churchill in years. Confidence in himself, like he knew what he was doing. It wasn’t certain if he actually did know what he was doing, but the potential was there, and that alone was enough for many to conclude that the Old Dog had, indeed, gotten its bite back."

UPI.48.desc:0 "In Doon, there was an arms industry growing. Not one that was particularly notable, or famous, and certainly not like its larger cousin in Khyber. But it existed, and its local gunsmiths would show off their wares to everyone and anyone. They didn’t discriminate between an Indian who worked for Churchill, or an Indian who wanted to murder Churchill. \n\n But when Churchill’s men came en masse, it was easy to see why many were concerned, afraid even, of their coming. But instead of trying to seize the firearms, instead of trying to steal things, the men came with goods from Lucknow. Nothing fancy - steel and alcohol (mostly the stuff even Churchill thought too disgusting to touch, but alcohol nonetheless), silks and brass and gold, things pillaged from the palace and pilfered from the public. \n\n The gunsmiths showed off their wares, the highest quality to the lowest grade, and tested each gun before accepting payment, as requested. A few fingers were lost, but in the end, thousands of guns were taken out of Doon, and brought into the United Province’s Provisional Armed Forces."

Now, he had his eyes on the beautiful, jade-green waters of the Indian ocean. Now, he was truly and well a man worthy of the title ‘Lord Admiral’ once more, as his conquests had proven him to the world. Now, he could contact Britain. And from there? The sky was the limit."

None of them were legal. \n\n The army had taken to finding these documents, and burning them. Not that it did any good - more would be up the day after."

UPI.51.t:0 "A Problem"
UPI.51.desc:0 "“Sir, there’s a problem,” said a soldier who rushed in most rudely and most unexpectedly. Churchill looked up from the documents, and down to the bottle of wine he had. The greatest benefit that taking Bihar had granted was that those bastards were hiding more than enough liquor to drown Churchill in. \n\n “What’s wrong, kid?” Churchhill chuckled. “Can’t you handle a few upstarts?” He could guess what the soldier was going to say. Every report said the same thing - a few uppity idiots, a few stones thrown, a few shots fired. It was all the same. \n\n “Sir, the Lucknow Garrison is under siege.”"
UPI.51.a:0 "What?!"

UPI.52.t:0 "Riots"
UPI.52.desc:0 "“Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!” The chants of thousands of people, running through Lucknow, filled the air. The crack of rifles and pistols accented the noise, the commotion, the rioting. Police barricades were of no use. Police batons only angered the people. As the night wore on, as countless battles between protestors and police were won and lost by each side, the orders came down from Churchill - it was time to bring out the big guns. \n\n Specifically, the Vickers guns. The rat-atta-atta of heavy machine guns, a sound any veteran of the Great War was familiar with, drowned out the chants and the riots, as thousands were wounded, gunned down, their lives cut short. \n\n Churchill watched, a dour expression on his face, as the fires burned. \n\n This would require steep punishment."

Curfew was imposed last night, yes, but certainly the soldiers would understand if he wanted to light his oven at the same time he did every day. Some of them were locals, or had lived here long enough to be called locals, and most of them had eaten his breads with their curries anyways. Certainly, that meant some leniancy. He hadn’t even participated in the riots or the protests, he had always kept his head down. \n\n And yet still he lay in his own blood, a casuality of Churchill’s order."

What would happen to all the china and crystal glass? \n\n Regardless, he ordered the attack. It started within the hour - gas, shrapnel, whatever they could use to punish the Indians, all rained down on his own capital. If this didn’t bring peace, then nothing would. If this didn’t show he had everything in control, nothing would. This was desperate, yes, this was desperate, and his generals had pushed back, but what did they know? What did they know about war? Nothing, and if they knew nothing, then he would take over. He would maintain control, he would maintain order, casualities be damned, and if none of this worked, then nothing else would!"

He just knew he needed to get the fuck out. No more did he cling to the dream of civilizing India, not when his life was on the line. \n\n “Go faster!” He roared at his valet, whose fearful jerk away from his master drove them off the road. From the gravel road, into a tree. \n\n Churchill stumbled out of the car, not bothering to check if his valet was okay, and collapsed on the side of the road.

The villagers reported to their leader that Churchill had been found and killed, and it was shortly thereafter that all hell really broke loose. \n\n In Lucknow, where the bodies had still yet to be cleaned up, people struggled for control of key industrial points, for the water supplies, for the administrative palace, for every scrap of land there could be. In the villages, people prepared raids against percieved enemies.

So that old Italian Machiavelli seems as good a place as any, perhaps with older texts too, by philosopher-Kings and those who seemed to have a good head on their shoulders. \n\n Even engaging in a bit of self-flagellation, Churchill read reports from battle, from generals, how the British engaged in discipline and combat.

Every man and woman has a duty in the world - set upon them by their race, their creed, their ideologies. Many of these duties are tempting, false ideas. One merely must look at the Bolsheviks and their failed uprising to see that. No, duty is something that runs deeper, much deeper than that.” \n\n “Whereas the French, seemingly, have abandoned the principles that so long ago made their country a threat to the British Empire, and the Russians have clung to the haggard hopes that obedience to some power shall keep them strong, and the Americans fall deeper into the perverse belief in the market, I come with something stronger. Something more powerful. What has united the great Empires throughout history, of course, is not clinging to one’s self, not clinging to one’s family, but to have a great calling to advance, to bring about change, to free those less fortunate from the squalor and filth they rot in. This is why the Englishman is in India. This is why the Englishman is right to be in India. This is what our duty is - to free those who are less unfortunate. They can never be of us, nor shall we ever be of them, but what beauty is there in giving them something greater to aspire to? They may protest, and claim we are murderers. We are murderers of the past, killers of the rot, purgers of those who would rather be free in filth than slaves in civilization.” \n\n “Where they claim to have built great structures, we shall tear down these edifices.

Churchill watched the scene from afar, seeing not two groups of people, but two masses of meat combatting each other, a nameless horde trying to tear apart his vision.

One of the ones that...encouraged people to sign up for that murderer’s army. I didn’t think anyone would see me, but there was a fucking guard patrol passing by right as I stuffed the remains down a chamberpot.” \n\n “That’s it? Pathetic,” laughed the scarred man. “Churchy’s getting afraid, isn’t he? I got in here for putting up counter-posters...two years ago. Denouncing his rations and all that. Told people in my marketplace to rise up, refuse service to his soldiers. We could have stopped this then, but…” \n\n He sighed. “The man’s getting scared. And scared men hate thoughts that contradict their own.” \n\n “What do we do now?” \n\n “Fuck, there isn’t much to do, is there? Sit, rot, wait until they decide we’re in the yard getting shot.

All of them had rifles, from the black-powder musket that a great-grandfather had loaned, to a stolen SMLE, to everything in between. None of them could take this anymore. Grandmothers, brothers, sons, mothers, all of them had been taken away by this bastard and his army. All of them had suffered, lost food, had their meals taken from their mouths and their families subject to horrid affairs. Disappeared family and friends, arrested co-workers, shot neighbors. \n\n It was inevitable that such cruelty would foment resistance, and they were just one group, waiting to extract their revenge and hurt Churchill, just a tiny bit. Even if it was a few dead men, it was something, some tiny toll extracted from him in penance for his own cruelty. \n\n At long last, the group of five soldiers came down the dirt road, talking to each other about the different ways you could use tonic water so it wouldn’t taste like shit. The ambushers put their rifles to their guns, hiding in the shadow of the forest, and as soon as they had their targets, pulled the triggers."

He was shaking, sweating. His hand trembled compulsively in his dirty suit pocket, and the aide next to him tried to reassure him. Everything would be fine - the soldiers here were protecting him, making sure he was safe. No need to fear such disorganized rabble, right? \n\n The aide was silenced by a bullet slamming into his skull, through one end and out the other, and ramming into Churchill’s breast pocket. Blood splattered across his face, seeped through the jacket. He could only grumble out an order to ‘floor it!’ as the car picked up speed, drove through the streets with little regard for safety.

He wasn’t sure what time it was, or even what day it was, and his memories were hazy. \n\n Two soldiers, one sitting, looking bored, and another standing by the door, greeted him, offering their hands to shake. \n\n “Hello, sir,” one said. “Glad you’re awake. We don’t mean to trouble you, but the generals told us you needed to know some things before you came back to Delhi.” \n\n “Oh, Christ,” he groaned. “What happened?” \n\n “The riots there have been put down successfully - it took a lot of bullets, and we lost a few hundred good men, but they’re down. Many of the local police services were helpful, as were the Native regiments, who we half-suspected armed your attempted assassin, but there’s little evidence to suggest that. We replaced the commanders anyways, just to be safe.” A coy smirk on the sitting soldier’s face told Churchill exactly what had been meant by “replaced.” \n\n “It’s safe to return, and can I just say, sir...”"

The executed man often begs for his life, but most of our men do not speak their language. It is easier when that’s the case. Pull the trigger, see them slump. Untie them. Bring in the next batch. Over, and over, and over. It is difficult, yes, and many men take to drinking to sooth their agonized hearts. Remind them this is correct.

Entire departments, if need be, have been reassigned or punished as seen fit. It was a blow to manpower, yes, and definitely upset some of the higher ups, but it had to be done. \n\n Churchill wanted more people to help keep order - the natural result of that was to hire criminals, to replace people he could with men willing to do the job. The impulse to violence was natural, yes, but it could be harnessed in better or worse ways. Churchill intended it to be used in the best way he could."

No police officer could now say “the chief said we couldn’t,” because he was telling them now that they could. \n\n English as the sole language across the territory - speak whatever you wish at home, but to any official, it had to be English. Close watch on everyone, ensure everyone and everything was kept an eye on. More people brought into the force, requirements dropped. If you could hold a gun, you could protect India.

To this end, of course, shock can be applied. Villages that thought themselves safe will be getting visits from the army. Crevices in the cities can be smoked out. Rebelliousness grows like a weed, and merely removing the stem does not stop its roots from growing. It is, of course and always, a matter of force and power. This is something he’s learned over the years, this is something he’s been made to face in the last few years, and it’s something he will, without a single moment’s hesitation, apply now.

Pools only use a diluted amount, after all - not enough to seriously hurt someone. When chlorine gas drops, everything else vanishes. The smell of flowers, of the forest, of the bustling city, everything is overtaken by an acrid, evil, bitterness that chokes out all life. The first reaction, of course, is to breath in and out, to try to and purge the smell in some way. But it doesn’t work like that. The first breath you take, everything hurts. Hydrochloric acid forms in your lungs, on your eyes, in the mucus tissues of your mouth and nose. Pain forces you to the ground, and you breath in more. And more. And more. Until you drown in your own agony, dribbling foamed blood from the mouth. It takes only a few men to condemn thousands to a horrid, slow, death. After opening the valve, the soldiers need only make sure their masks are secure, and that their enemies have no such protection."

With scant few projectors and radios, it’s often difficult to communicate what’s going on, but the assurances matter to those who can tune in and listen. Churchill’s voice is commanding and calm, telling the people of India exactly what they want to hear. His words are precisely chosen, his methods of delivery, even on the audio-only media, are remarkable. \n\n Of course, how much truth he bends, how much he needs to assure them that they are reaping the fruits of their own hard labour, and other such things, are of little concern. As a family sits down for dinner, as the husband opens a bottle of wine and insists the radio is turned on, they hear an official congratulations to him, telling the entire world how excellent he is in the conduct of his duties, how the soldiers of his battalion have praised him so admirably. The husband freezes, and asks the wife to shut it off. \n\n The family eats in silence, understanding that this commendation, while meant in good faith and cheer by the Governor, has just done something unspeakable. No one raises the remark, or states the obvious, but they all know that..."

As the new maps showing gains rolled in, with notes saying they were already outdated, he knew that no matter what happened, the English had once more proved their supremacy on the continent. More land, more gains, more security and control and above all more people to rule. It was stretching him thin, but he could maintain the momentum, that much he knew. He was, once more, victorious.

How many of these half-human apes have we had to shoot? We could be sipping tea in a palace, but Britain decided that was too good for us.” \n\n “I mean…” Paul let out a sigh. “Look, we’re in the trenches. We’re fighting our own people - our own friends and family, in another life. Do you really think that’s right? Can you...can you honestly, really say that you’re happy doing this?” \n\n “No, I’m not fucking happy, Paul! I’m not exactly overjoyed by this, you know? But it’s not our fucking fault! If you really, honestly, think that those traitors ‘cross the line are your friends, go and try to greet them! See how much lead they pump into you.” \n\n Paul sighed, put down his rifle, and nodded.

The British Empire has declined over these many years, and this has been apparent to all observers, to all who might seek to understand it. In the corpse of empires, there are maggots, warlords who feast upon the corpse and give back nothing but more chaos and grime and filth. But there are also figures of great repute who stand to hold back the tide. We men of India, we soldiers of the Raj, are such figures. A new Charlemagne, a new Napoleon, a new Bismark, has risen in India, and the sun of the British Empire has set. Ours, however, has just begun rising. God bless India. God bless us all.”"

UPI.703.desc:0 "We are ready - as ready as can be, for we are here to birth a new world. In fire, sword, destruction. By bullet, shell, and bomb, we shall force this new world to emerge, shall force it to wriggle its way from the void and impose itself upon our rotten corpse of a world. It shall be beautiful, as a fire burning a home. It shall be deadly, as the hawk diving upon the rabbit. It shall be unrelenting as the sea, as unstoppable as the tide, and it shall ensure that all are swept up in it."

UPI.704.t:0 "Radio Silence"
UPI.704.desc:0 "The unbelievable had come to pass. Britain, his home, his native land was... Destroyed. All his efforts in unifying and pacifying this dreaded subcontinent... Were they for nothing? After all, what would it mean to be a noble servant of the British Crown, if the crown was no longer there? Churchill struggled to keep his upper lip stiff, and took a sip from his whiskey. No, Churchill would not succumb to defeat. Not again. Not after a victory of this caliber. Brittania might not rule no more. But the Briton would never, ever be a slave, even without his dear homeland. The isles of Brittania had fallen, but the Briton, his spirit, his courage, lived on far from home, in the Raj. He was already wasting time. Churchill would ensure the Raj would be a shining light of Anglo civilisation, and that would require fully re-unifying this land, once and for all."
