ISR.2.t:0 "First Elections to the Knesset"
ISR.2.desc:0 "Now that the chaos of post-independence has been dealt with, the time has come for Israel’s first ever general election in order to select its first prime minister.\n\nThe immediate frontrunner is David Ben-Gurion representing the Mapai. The party rejects both the Marxism of Labour Unity and the nationalism of Revisionist Zionism. Although the party advocates for liberal democracy, they also emphasize the need for social programs and worker's rights in a uniquely Zionist conception of social democracy. Critics from both the right and left have called the Mapai a more moderate version of Poale Zion, and the socialist-zionist core has been split between the two due to their refusal to commit to a pro-German foreign policy. The Mapai has also refused to make statements on Palestine, stating that the needs of the Jewish people should be taken care of before the issue can even be discussed internally.\n\nThe primary opposition to Ben-Gurion is Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the Revisionist Zionists. This party believes in territorial maximalism for Israel, expansionism and militarism, and encouragement of immigration by non-Israeli Jews to the land of Israel. This militarist and right-wing form of Zionism means that the rights of Palestinians will be secondary to the creation of a Greater Israel. Jabotinsky’s connections with the British also means his party are pro-Commonwealth, and will seek the help of the British if needed.\n\nThe final group, which has the least amount of popular support, are the Labour Zionists. The two Socialist-Zionist parties, Labour Unity and Paole Zion both seek to establish a worker's state in the land of Israel, so that the Jewish proletariat can participate in the international class struggle, in much the same fashion as the Germans. The Labour Unity have also adopted a Marxist view of history and colonialism as part of their party platform, and are thus somewhat more willing to cooperate with the native Arab population, though not to the detriment of Israel. The Paole Zion however are much more moderate, the party rejects both the Marxism of Labour Unity and the nationalism of Revisionist Zionism. Although the party advocates for socialism, and will cooperate with both the Mapai and Labour Unity, they believe the Mapai policies to be too soft and liberal, and the Labour Unity too radical, hampering their vote share. Any strongly leftist government will be a coalition of sorts, and the leadership question is hotly debated."

ISR.201.desc:0 "Israeli elections returned an inconclusive result, but internal negotiations among socialist-zionists returned only one name that both could agree on to lead the coalition - famed Jewish theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. Although currently living in Germany, Einstein has been vocal in his support of the fledgling state, and has shown support for socialist-zionism. Applauding the recent election victory and the defeat of the revisionist zionists.\n\nAfter some assurances from the parties wore through his humility, Einstein graciously accepted the proposal, a radio reading of his acceptance letter thanking the Israeli people for welcoming him with such enthusiasm was well received in Tel Aviv. The chief condition of Einstein’s premiership it seems, is socialist-zionist unity, he stated that Israel can never prosper while the left cannibalizes itself. The new coalition between Poale Zion and the Labor Zionists is now under pressure to cooperate, lest they fail Einstein. While radicals from both parties have objected, stating that neither the coalition nor its constituent parties will survive such a merger, the vast majority of both the people and party members have celebrated its founding."

ISR.3.t:0 "Peel Commission’s Decision Causes Further Arab Revolts"
ISR.3.desc:0 "In response to the unrest of April 1936, the British government established the Palestine Royal Commission, colloquially called the Peel Commission after its head, Lord Peel. After much deliberation and investigation into the exact cause of the protests, it was determined, in a truly inspirational and thorough analysis, that the unrest had been caused by “ethnic tension between Arabs, Jewish settlers, and British authorities”. Obvious conclusions aside, the resolution did kick off the process of finding a solution to said ethnic tensions, in the form of a new partition. Although neither side was particularly thrilled about this idea to begin with, particularly the more radical nationalists who had hoped for a completely independent Palestine, things really began to shift once it was announced that Jewish settlements, which up until now were spread thinly along the coastal west of the nation, would now make up a majority of the Northern plains of Palestine. While Arab groups are unanimously opposed to such a rapid expansion of Jewish settlement, the Jewish side of the argument is bitterly divided. For example, Labor Zionists, the Paole Zion under David Ben-Gurion, and most of the members of the Haganah are opposed to the partition, claiming that such a drastic overstep is a transparent and punishing response to the events of April 1936, and that punishment of all Arabs for the actions of a few protestors will only drive Arabs further into the arms of radical groups. Meanwhile,  the Irgun and Lehi see no issue with the partition, except for the most militant among them who say it does not go far enough in handing control of the Eretz Yisrael, or Land of Israel, to Jewish settlers.\n\nDespite their differences, however, the Irgun, Lehi, and Haganah have all taken quickly to the task of cooperation in the defense of Jewish settlements against a new wave of Palestinian backlash. But as they fight side by side and come into increasing contact with one another, the cracks in the alliance are beginning to show, with the more passionate of the three groups denouncing their rivals as “False Zionists”. As the unity between Jews collapses, Arab unity against colonization has increased exponentially, with Vanguardist rebels and traditionalist Muslim clerics agreeing to cease their infighting, at least for the duration of the coming conflict.\n\nThe whole colony is like a bundle of dynamite waiting to explode, and Peel just lit the fuse."

With the Jewish state secure from British colonialism and Arab revolution, there is no longer anything left to unify the various political factions of the state. As the Labour Zionists, the Paole Zion, and the Revisionist Zionists under Ze’ev Jabotinsky attempted to form a new government, radicals in the Lehi and Irgun turned on Jabotinsky, Declaring him to be a “False Zionist”, despite being the founder of their ideology. Jabotinsky has responded by reaffirming his pro-government position, labeling the Irgun and Lehi as treasonous rebels merely masquerading as Zionists. Haim Wizman, provisional president of Israel, made attempts to mediate the conflict between the two groups, but was unsuccessful in even getting them to agree to a negotiation. In a last ditch effort to avoid persecution by the newly formed Mossad, Avraham Stern has led joint Irgun-Lehi forces in an assault on the capitol in an attempt to arrest Jabotinsky and coup the government. As Stern’s cabal tried to march up the steps of the capitol building, they found Haganah militias waiting for them there. Thinking quickly, Stern improvised a speech to sway them to their side.

Israel may be a valuable asset in the task of world revolution, but at the same time it may draw the International into a premature war with the British. Recognition of Israel's independence will cause Arab workers to view Germany with skeptical eyes which will slow the expansion of socialism in the Middle East.On the other hand, however, in the long run and with small efforts on the part of Germany, it will enable the creation of a socialist fortress in the Middle East, which will be able to flourish under German protection. It will also be seen as a blow against world capital in view of the exceptionally tragic history of the Jews which will give Germany the title of defender of the oppressed. No matter what decision the president makes, it will eventually have to be answered to the government in Jerusalem."

The French will be able to have an ally to help attack the British colonies, but the Jews want protection in return.It is rather a pragmatic cooperation resulting from the existing situation than a friendly proposal. The Jews still remember that the French were reluctant to see their customs as nonconformists, but the government in Jerusalem is prepared to forget the wrongs as long as the French support the Jews militarily.

The investment in Israel could turn against the French because they are not even sure whether the Jews will actually be willing to support the French in a potential war against the British. Stern believed that even without the French, the Lehi government would be able to defend itself against the Arabs and the British, but nevertheless felt disappointed by the attitude of the French, who prefer ideological matters to pragmatists."

In addition to trade agreements, he asked for the recognition of Israel's independence as a separate state from the Kingdom of Syria and the possibility of joining the Commonwealth. Britain will gain a valuable ally in the Middle East because even though Israel is a young, small country, it has quite a strong development potential. The problem is that Israel does not have good relations with the Arab states, which may end in increasing oil prices, but also the risk of Arab attacks on the Trucial States. Not to mention bringing Britain into a potential war in the Middle East. At a time of global instability, providing rival powers the chance to weaken British influence in the Middle East and could even deprive British Trucial States on the Arabian peninsula. The refusal will also amount to a certain stain on honor related to the refusal of another democratic country to cooperate, however the Prime Minister of Great Britain should think carefully before making a decision."
