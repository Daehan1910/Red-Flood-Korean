april_fools.7.t:0 "Max's first day as the president"
april_fools.7.desc:0 "This morning it was particularly rainy in Washington D.C. Max, a former freelance detective, hyperkinetic rabbity thing and now officially the president of the United States entered the empty Oval Office. His partner in work and love, a former freelance detective --now Vice President Sam walked in just behind him. The overweight, anthropomorphic dog looked around the room and adjusted his blue and black striped tie. Then he placed his eyes on the little rabbit and asked:\n\n\"Hey Max, remember when I said that I join America and the rest of the free world in praying that would never happen?\"\n\n\"Well, either Allah didn't listen to you or it's the praying that never happened.\" -Max replied.\n\n\"Either way, how does it feel to be the president of the United States?\"\n\n\"Incredible! Now I can do anything I ever wanted, like for example...\"\n\nMax was interrupted by a loud ringing. It was the telephone of the oval office. In the blink of an eye Max ran to answer it, screaming:\n\n\"I GOT IT! I GOT IT!\"\n\nSuddenly Sam picked up an old lamp and smashed the little rabbit with it like a golf ball, sending him flying to the other side of the room and buying enough time to answer the phone himself.\n\n\"Hello? Yes! Yes! Oh, alright! Got it! You too! Goodbye!\"\n\nSam put down the phone loudly. Max quickly got up on his feet and asked:"

april_fools.15.desc:0 "\"It was the commissioner\" --said Sam as he turned towards his partner. \"He has a new job for us. You see, now that you are the most powerful bunny in this country and I am the most powerful dog, he wants us to end crime in the USA once for all. Not only that, he also wanted you to bring the country to prosperity and reinstate it as a great power, since that's apparently what you are supposed to do as a president.\"\n\nThe enthusiasm on Max's face turned into an aggrieved scowl. He shouted: \"Oh, come on! I didn't even get to capture all these hippos so I can dump them into Britain. Ugh… What do we have to do?\"\n\n\"Well, there's the economic depression, terrifyingly high unemployment rate, the dustbowl crippling our agriculture and...\"\n\n\"Well, this country is beyond saving. We might as well start over or bring about it's end if you ask me.\"\n\n\"Hmm… Max, that's genius! Think about it, Mellon's presidency of idling and letting the country continue the status quo has only worsened the economic and sociopolitical climate. That indicates maybe it's the American values we were taught to worship that are at fault! There is only one way to repair America, and that's...\"\n\n\"To destroy it's over one hundred year long legacy as the Land of the Free! Sam, let's go shell the Statue of Liberty with artillery fire just like Artaud shot the paintings he ejaculated on!\"\n\n\"Better start drawing up our plans then.\" --said Sam as he reached for a pen and a piece of paper.\n\n\"Suffrage?\"\n\n\"Zero votes per household!\"\n\n\"Economic freedoms?\"\n\n\"Appropriate all! Nothing outside of the nation!\"\n\n\"Right to bear firearms?\"\n\n\"Wait, no! We're keeping this one-- but only for me and myself!\"\n\n\"You crack me up little pal.\""

april_fools.9.t:0 "A Gamble"
april_fools.9.desc:0 "Heinrich pushed his glasses up his nose, squinting at the area behind his chicken coop. He had managed to prosper these past few years, raising a few hundred hens and a few dozen roosters. However, he thought of going bigger. The government was desperate to achieve \"Socialist Plenty\" in animal products, and had begun releasing generous permits to conduct massive livestock operations. Heinrich's books showed consistent excellence in resource management and he was well-liked by the local agricultural union. In other words, he would be a shoe-in for approval. The question was, did he want to take on the added stress of expansion, or just be content with his current peaceful and moderately prosperous way of life? To turn down such an offer would seem mad, but it certainly was a risk, and Heinrich debated whether or not the risk was worth it. Did he want to roll the dice on the life he loved? Or did he want to simmer down, be humble, and enjoy the gifts that he's been given?"

april_fools.10.t:0 "A Loss"
april_fools.10.desc:0 "Heinrich Himmler's chicken farm had grown into a truly vast enterprise. The newest manuals on factory farming from Britain were remarkable-- he was getting egg yields he had never thought possible! The union was ecstatic, and there were rumors that some of the best known chicken farmers in the nation would soon follow what was being called the Himmler Doctrine. \n\nHowever, not everything was going sunny-side up for the humble poultryman. As his farm expanded, so did the attacks he faced. That pesky Hermann Göring and the rest of Die Tierfreunde were constantly harassing him, spitting on him, calling him a rat-faced murderer, and \"liberating\" his chickens. One day, he had enough. As he stepped out to walk to the police station and report the hooligan, he felt a great wave of force slam into his back as the ground gave way beneath him. \n\nHe woke up in a maze of mazes of green grass, the Blood of the Lamb coating the Lion's claws all around him. He did not belong, not as he was. Less than an ant, less than a worm, before this terrible might. It peered inside his soul, naming itself to him. Agartha it was, Land of Lands, heart of this world and home of the Aryan race. It enfolded him in its power, and he rose once more, out of the bosom of the earth and into the void above his chicken farm. He saw the coward Göring shaking with fear as he flew towards him, chanting the proto-proto-proto-Vedas and cursing the names of the Annunaki. He felt a bullet strike his side. As he fell to the earth, saved only by his Super Magical Aryan Healing (tm dont steal) he knew that his battle with Göring had only just begun."

On the other, Heinrich Himmler, Blessed of Agartha, whose esoteric powers have cowed the country's farmers into submission, wielding magic from Aryan prehistory. In the middle stands majority of Germans and the KPD itself, who in order to escape wrath of the titans fortified themselves in Frankfurt.

april_fools.6.desc:0 "Paris awoke to the roar of motors. This by itself was not unusual. The gunfire was.\nTanks rolled over the Champs de Mars as Escadron troops attempted to block their advance. Confusion was absolute. Was it the Celts? The Acephale? \nThe tanks pulled up to the Tuileries palace and drove right through the walls, settling in the central garden. The entire State Artistic Council ran out to confront them, guns at the ready. Artaud led the charge, fully prepared to die to destroy these traitors to France.\nSuddenly, the hatch of the lead tank opened, and out popped-- hold on-- was that fucking Fernand Leger?! He hadn’t been seen since before the regime change! He was dead!\nLeger grinned at the councillors before him, still bleary from sleep. “Gentlemen!” he cried, sweeping his arm over the tanks, “it is just as you see. Le Soleil is ours, and the instruments of the State have been cowed by our superior force. I will be taking the reins of the nation, to save it in this time of disaster. Now, you, Antonin, have a choice to make.”\nHe stepped down from the tank and approached Artaud, holding out his hand to shake. “Are you with me?” he said, as his other hand raised a shining dagger, “Or against me? Answer now!”"

april_fools.16.desc:0 "I shot out of bed at exactly 5:47 am, grabbing my sweat towel and giving myself a thorough wipe-down. I gave thanks to based Bataille for another juicy, steamy morning. I grabbed the clips, put them on and turned on the car battery. \"FASTER FASTER FASTER\" I yelled to daddy Artaud as the current cooked my nads. \"Better get going, need to stay on task.\" I quickly slipped on my leather jacket and boxer shorts and sprinted to the nearest Sonic, pushing one of the waitresses over and grabbing the food out of her hands. \"Shouldn't have been trad, idiot\" I whispered as I slipped the roller skates off her feet (oh those are ripe) and I got my roll on, skating back to my apartment at velocities that would make Marinetti (PBUH) proud. \"With a rollerskates, you can go anywhere you want\" I said, out loud.  \n\nAs soon as I got home I started up Draw.io. \"Bourbaki formalist neo-Pythagorean EsoMathSocAccel France path?\" I asked my friend in the mirror. \"What a great idea, you majestic stallion!\" I began to giggle, imagining the cringe soy reddit rage when we teased \"Set Theory for the State\" focuses.  With that trilemma settled, I took my mandatory 15 minute break to pray. \"Accelerationism is just Fast Fascism, praise be to our fathers Mussolini, D'Annunzio, and Marinetti IN THAT ORDER. They teach us that Fascism is when there's weird art and leather, and the more weird art and leather the fascister it is.\" I felt my tears of rapture mixing with the burger grease on my face into a delicious nectar, which I scraped off my face and offered to the altar. I would need their guidance in the hours ahead. \n\nAfter hanging the White Monster IV bag, I finished the focus tree. Fully implemented in just 25 minutes, still not even close to my record though *swag*. I didn't worry about descriptions or events, the Loc Fairy would take care of that. I started to gently convulse, wiping my chin. \"Uh oh, foaming again.\" It only took ten hours for the spasms to end this time, that was a relief. Before going to bed, I ran down to the gas station to grab dinner. I snagged a nozzle and selected 94 octane, guzzling the sweet Modernity Juice as fast as I could. Once my after-dinner blackout was over I got into bed. I needed to be up bright and early tomorrow so I could delay the update for the 20th time this month. I smiled as the motors began to roar behind my eyes."
