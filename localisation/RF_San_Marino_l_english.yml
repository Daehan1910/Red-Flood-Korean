#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_BENITO_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was a man with many names. §GIl Duce§!, §WIl Liberatore§!, §RIl Nuovo Augusto§!. Mussolini was a man with a singular  drive, a drive that launched him rising through the Italian political scene, a drive to burn away the decadent old systems of his homeland; to see Italy reborn as a phoenix in the mold of §RRome§!. It was this drive that lead him to create the §YFasci Italiani di Combattimento§!, and while the success seen by his group lead many to believe that one day he would infact take the role of sole leader over the Italian people, those dreams were soon dashed. After signing the §YPact of Pacification§! in 1921 and formalizing an alliance with the socialists against the liberals and the King, many of the former members of the Fasci deserted him, including the infamous §RItalo Balbo§!. Mussolini thought that the newfound forces he had gathered together would be enough, and on October 27, 1922, Mussolini lead a coalition of socialists, futurists, and many others forward in what would forever be remembered as the §YMarch on Rome§!.\n\n Sadly for Mussolini, it appeared that the cards were not in his favor, as the March was violently surpressed, splintering the newly formed §YPartito Laburista Fascista§! as almost all sides deserted him. However, a man's spirit is a powerful force, and Benito Mussolini was a man who was possessed by a spirit from §RRoman§! history. He took the few men he had remaining and met up with §YGiuliano Gozi§!, set his sights on San Marino, and this time, it appeared that Lady Luck had smiled upon him. His §GMarch on San Marino§! in 1923 succeeded, and the Most Serene Republic bent its knee to Il Duce. Now, Mussolini spends his days preparing for a §RNuovo Risorgimento§!, a new March on Rome to unify the Italian people once and for all, under the reign of the §GHeir of Garibaldi§!, Benito Mussolini."
