In this blasted jungle every day, every week and every month were the same, they grew one into another like evergrowing tendrils of this green hell. They were everywhere. 꺾고 베고 태우는 게 생장을 늦출진 몰라도, but they continued to slither their way back in strangling the camp like thousends of snakes.\n Corporal look at his face in a shard of a mirror jammed into wall of his hut. He could barely recognise himself. The face belonged to an old man, not that of a youth he saw in the photograph among his documents. 가족들은 이 얼굴을 알아볼까요? 그러고나 싶어는 할까요? \n He considered for a moment shaving himself while staring into unkempt abomination of stringy hair caked in old sweat that covered his lower half of his face. He must been stinking to hight hell. 굳이 냄새를 맡진 않았습니다. 여기선 모든 것에서 냄새가 가득하니까요. 병사들, 노동자들, 침대들까지. 온 밀림에 죽음의 냄새가 베어들었습니다. 빠져나갈 길은 없었습니다. 모든 것이 죽음과 부패의 악취를 풍기고 있었습니다. 그들의 뼈 아래, 영혼까지 스며든 채로.\n '생일 선물을 풀어볼 시간이네, corporal.' 건조하게 말하며 그는 자신의 리볼버에 손을 뻗었습니다. 신속한, 거의 기계적인 움직임과 동시에 콜베르는 약실에서 모든 탄환을 빼낸 뒤 단 한 발만을 남겨두었습니다. '1년 내내 이 순간을 기다렸지, corporal. 제일 좋아하는 거 나도 알아.'\n 콜베르는 약실을 돌려보고 공이치기를 당겨보기 전까지 이 오래된 권총을 빤히 쳐다봤습니다. 큰 한숨을 내쉬며, 콜베르는 총신을 자신의 관자놀이에 가져다 댔습니다. A drop of sweat ran from his forhead across his cheek as the hut was filled with dense, suffocating silence.\n After what seemed to be an eternity hammer hit with a quiet clang against the empty chamber.

Shade that suffocated and strangled men and plants alike while offering no refuge from heat as if swarms of infinite flies buzzed at the meat of the carcas-state.\n Elisabethville was at the horizon. Or at least what was currently haphazardly build out of war-hollowed remains of it. City itself was a living corpse, a skeleton of brick and wood strung together with thick ropes of hopeless determination. Men and women lived there like scared rats right under eyes of an exterminator.\n But despite all they lived the best they could. A bored man in a patched hat tried to sell fresh fruits out of a stand. Woman admired herself in a broken mirror, spider web-like surface returning her dozens of brilliant smiles.

He spoke through a villager from another tribe who knew their native tongue rather poorly and most likely barely understood the white man in the first place. But he and others listened to his words anyway, some from curiosity, some counting on gifts he might be bearing, some to kill boredom.\n/Old man spoke of many things, many strange things. Of great god of his people, of his son and of their tribe in the skies. But also of a horrible place where the god cast those who he rejects. 암흑과 불의, 비탄과 사악의 땅. A great furnace where unworthy are thrown to burn for all times for their crimes against him.\n루쉬쿠는 이제 그 노인이 말했던 곳에 자기가 있음을 알게 되었습니다.\n얼마나 오랜진 알 수 없었습니다. 한평생? 영겁의 생들? 1년? 이곳에서 시간은 아무런 차이도 갖지 않습니다. 해도, 달도, 별도 이곳엔 없습니다. 노인의 신이 사는 곳에 하늘은 없습니다. 끝없는 동굴 속에, 열기가 식지 않는 공기와 돌에 부딪히는 도구들의 소리만이 있을뿐입니다. 노인의 신은 그들을 일하게 하고, 노인의 신은 그들에게 역겨운 음식물 찌꺼기를 먹였으며, 노인의 신인 꿈 속에서 그들 앞에 나타났습니다. 안식처는 없으며, 휴식도 없습니다. 진짜 빛도 없습니다. 이들이 파고드는 지구의 깊은 자궁엔 해도 닿지 않습니다. 오직 흔들대며 흐릿한 화염의 빛이 앞을 밝힙니다. 이 지옥과 같은 빛 속에서 보이는 루쉬쿠는 손은 악몽에서 볼 법한 해골의 손과 같았습니다. 동료들의 얼굴은 뼈만 남아 채찍과 사슬을 따라 억지로 움죽이는 망자와 같았습니다.\n\n죽은 자와 눈먼 자가 그의 시기를 샀습니다.\n무너진 이들은 마지막 피 한 방울까지 바닥에 털어내고 육신을 떠났습니다. 이제 이들에겐 무엇이 남은 걸까요? 그 영혼들은 이 비탄에서 벗어난 걸까요? 해와 숲을 향해 돌아간 걸까요?\n\n루쉬쿠는 그렇게 믿지 않습니다. 비탄엔 끝이 없고, 죽음도 출로가 되어주진 않습니다. 쓰러진 이들은 그저 끝없는 갱도의 미로 속으로, 복수심으로 가득한 신이 데려온 괴물의 창자 속으로 더 깊이 들어갈 뿐입니다. 암흑과 열기 속에서, 주리고 지친 채 모두는 벽을 치고 또 칩니다.\n채찍이 그의 등을 때리며 괴물들의 역겨운 말들이 다시 귀에 울립니다. 루쉬쿠는 다시 힘겨이 걸어야만 합니다..."

Now he  wasn't even sure he could produce the sounds required to speak the word once serving as his name. But he didn't complain. Not just because he wasn't allowed to or didn't have anyone to complain to. He was someone. Born mangled and frail, maturing without growth... he was to be lowest among the low. Too weak to work, to small to fight. Ugly and despised.\nBut not for the Masters.\nThey took him, lifted him from the mud of his people and made him Puk.\nHe was feed scraps from Master's table. He wore clothes made by Them. He didn't work, he didn't fight. He just existed and that very fact was enough. Masters took strange joy in seeing him walk, try to climb furniture not fit for his size, wear clothes unfit for his body. He was amusing and that made Masters happy.\nOthers didn't made Them happy. They were lazy and ungrateful. They ate food they were given without giving praises, they bad-mouthed Masters behind their backs. This is why they were punished, this is why they suffered. Puk couldn't hide satisfaction seeing haughty giants broken under whips of the Masters. To see their perfect bodies bound and harnessed to do their bidding. To see those arms, those legs, those faces he was denied contorted into forced obedience to Those he was most loyal servant to. He, the lowly Puk might been but a lowly toad, a toy walking like a man but he too was like his Cruel Masters. He didn't dress like those working in the mines, he didn't walk like them, he didn't ate like them, he didn't talk like them. He knew words of Master's tongue, he knew their customs and their desires. When he followed one of Them around the camp prisoners looked at him with hatred of a cornered animal, he returned it with a look of a higher being he learned from his Masters. They were great teachers.\nToday he forced a boot way too big for his feet in front of one of the workers who fell from exhaustion. In a theatrical manner he demanded barely coucious man to kiss it. Masters laughed, their chests shaking and bright teeth flashing. And Puk laughed with them."

Photographs, keepsakes wrapped in old rags, notes. All one by one ended up in the flames making light dance on his warm face.\nOrders were clear. The colonists are to arrive. They can’t see any of this. They wouldn’t understand. No one would understand.\nHe looked for a while at one photo in particular, his eyes focused as if he was to see an old friend for the last time.

nbe.7.desc:0 "It was another sweltering morning in the great Green Hell that surrounded the New Belgians. From Léopoldville to Uele, the Congolese suffered for thousands of hours on end, with no great prospect of life beyond working for the right to die with their comrades in the dirty ground. They knew this was their very tail end of a chance to finally supress the absurdly thin forces of the New Belgians, and so, a commander by the nom de guerre of Bantou had been organizing for months for a major revolt against the New Belgians. Hoping to quickly gain support of the Kivu Cult in the east, those dreams were shattered as the Belgians rode across the mountains and annihilated every element of Kivu's socialism. Then, Bantou realized he had to act quickly, before the Belgians got any stronger and began to dismantle his network of partisans. Therefore, he launched a rising north of Elisabethville in the south of the Congo, near a New Belgian arms factory. The hope was that the local slaves would rise up with their partisan friends, who then would wipe out the garisson in Elisabethville, then subsequently hold the fort in the newly-liberated city. Things went to plan for a while, with the local partisans driving with a stolen car crashing through the gates, weapons in hand. However, the white officer holding the factory together was just outside his quarters, and quickly reacted by using one of the slaves as a human shield, and then hid behind a munitions box, shooting at the partisans and dyeing the factory floorboards an inky redish-brown. After some time, he was wounded and shot a slave in the leg, as others continued to quietly labour in horror of the potential that they might be shot next, with another white officer shooting at the 10 or so partisans. As the gunfire slowed, the newcomer drew a machete and hacked off the limb of the wounded slave, then seized the severed limb, sliced it open, and shoved in a fresh-made grenade. He spun and threw it at the Partisans in a single shockingly fluid motion. Shocked, they froze for the single moment they had to project as the gristly projectile arced toward them. The grenade detonated, shredding the bulk of the surviving rebels in a hail of hot metal. The stunned survivors were eliminated with machine efficiency as fresh Belgian fire team entered the factory chamber. And so, the munitions factory continued its operations as the now-disabled slave received a chair to sit on.\nBantou would not survive."

It had been many years since the unification of the Congo, and through a weak, but lengthy stream, thousands of Belgian women and men, sometimes children, arrived into the subcontinent prepared just for them; to treat them like gods. Pierre, a veteran of the Belgian Army Remnants, knew that his eyes looked nearly, if not completely, soulless. He looked at himself everyday in the mirror, seeing his deep, sunken blue eyes think about home. He knew that he had to make a home here, in this dark, green rainforest that refused to end. That was, of course, many years ago, and now he has a wife with him; one that read about these wonderful opportunities in a newly industrializing Congo, the jewel of her homeland which rose up against the death of her own nation. An immigrant from Dutch Flanders, she wanted to go to any place that represented her beloved nation, which did not have it's capital in either Liége, Le Soleil, or Amsterdam, but instead in Brussels. Regardless, she was Pierre's sweetheart, and the two had begun slowly sharing their language as per the New Belgian's  government request for national unity among the languages of the Belgians, with Walloon and Flemish immigrants, along with the soldiers themselves. Their child, Jan, was to be one of the first children born with a New Belgian birth certificate, and yet they wished to have so many more. Jan would be taught words in Flemish, Walloon, and words mixed together colloquially in the name of creating a new, New Belgian language. However, Jan will never be taught how much blood cost to create the nation around him."

As they reached Leopoldville, there were few celebrations, and more sighs of relief. The Belgians had pulled through, and finally could govern the Congo as it should be governed.\n\nPierre Ryckmans had begun his journey from Elisabethville to Leopoldville, slowly looking outside his car during the lengthy journey at all the animals and plants. Perhaps there were things to smile for in these virgin lands. Perhaps things were truly going to become better. Things had been painful and often merciless at the Belgian soldiers that just wanted to survive, and it showed in their deep, exhausted eyes. Thusly, when he finally arrived in Leopoldville, Ryckmans got to the largest podium he could find and proclaimed to an audience of white soldiers that he would... (WIP)"
