#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_BOUBOU_HAMA_DESC:0 "Children of escaped slaves, Boubou Hama has felt his ancestors' pains from birth. Working as a teacher by trade in Niamey, trained by the top class educators of French Africa over at the urban centre of Dakar, and then moving back to Niamey, by 1933 he realized France was barely able to hold her colonies, and subsequently began political studies behind doors to \"improve his curriculum\". Truth is, he was looking for ways to work within the system and bring autonomy, or perhaps even independence to his homeland. Turns out, fate was not looking at him well that year. As the French authority collapsed a year later within the Sahel and West African colonies, Boubou Hama was forced to take the reins of power by local native militias, which saw him as their educator and protector, even if slightly treasonous for working with the French (then again, what could be done at the time was severely limited). In this new position, his government in Niamey was desperate, disorganized, and poorly protected from Tuareg bandits, who by 1935 had sieged out Niamey and declared a Jihad against the secular Hama government. Desperate, destitute and left with no other choice, Boubou Hama's provisional Nigerien Army and his government fled upwards in the Niger river, escaping attacks by UDM militias in the borderlands as the Voltaic forces pacified the countryside. Now finding himself in the banks of the Niger in Mali, Hama and his comrades declared the Republic of Mali, which was previously held by a confusing mix of colonial remnants, democratic intellectuals and many other factions. This Republic had the exact same government as the one in Niamey, without being elected. With this, the Voltaic intervention in Mali began, as Bamako became sieged out, it seemed that Hama was destined to be a fleeing dog, dying in the sands of time. Yet, Providence fought against Fate and brought him great victories, driving the Voltaic forces back to the Niger river, protecting the small Nigerien Army and the Hama Government, all of which were given a great propaganda victory - yet one without meaning. The peoples of Mali, now at only 5% Songhai, as the rest was now under Voltaic jurisdiction, despise Hama's unelected Government. And yet, Boubou Hama stands, exhausted and depressed - yet strong in his resolve to go back to his homeland."

MLI_minuscule_ruling_minority:0 "Minuscule Ruling Minority"
MLI_minuscule_ruling_minority_desc:0 "The Songhai, prominent in Niger and in eastern French Sudan, have been the heirs of a great empire in the Sahel, and yet..! Their largest land dominated by them now is barely considered Songhai by any standards. The few Songhai that aren't in the Niger river are mostly refugees from Niamey who now exist in exile in Mali looking for ways to save the Sahel once more, akin to their ancient ancestors. But for now, Mali's authority has no popular support in terms of ethnic issues."
MLI_a_mans_vision:0 "단 한 사람의 전망"
MLI_a_mans_vision_desc:0 "The Republic of Mali is an artificial institution with no legitimacy. That is the view of almost every single citizen within it's borders, and yet it stands - not repressing its own people or trying to colonize their lands, but merely desperate soldiers trying to get by - and Hama's vision to come back home has enticed them to keep going, even if it all hurts so much."
