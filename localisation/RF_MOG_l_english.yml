Everyone is huddled, everyone is in a hurry, everyone is running somewhere - from secretaries loaded with folders and concerned officials, to journalists armed with notebooks and cameras. Not only reporters from almost all major Nikkei newspapers have appeared - next to them, but rows of seats are also occupied by representatives from the City Hall, people from Zaibatsu, cultural figures, and Shinto priests, and inconspicuous suits and white shirts of the middle-class alternate with expensive three-piece suits and even ceremonial kimonos. Huge banners covered with hieroglyphs slowly oscillate in the heated air... \n\"DAWN OF DEMOCRACY IN NIKKEI\" \n\"WE WILL BUILD A NEW WORLD WORTH OUR EFFORTS!\" There are so many of them that it is more like a carnival than a dry political event, but the same carnival, slightly relaxed atmosphere prevails in the souls. Nishimoto Rei is slightly dizzy. Yesterday he was a simple car mechanic who worked in a small workshop. Unknown and quite poor - luck has never smiled on Rei since moving from Japan. Of course, he enjoyed some respect in his neighborhood, but never, never in his life would he have thought that he could be nominated as a deputy in the first election in Nikkei! It was all so surreal as if he had mistakenly fallen into someone else's shoes, as if he had been confused with someone because deputies are not elected, they are appointed - at least until chaos engulfed the Brazilian Republic. Although his outfit has changed to a well-ironed, albeit cheap, jacket and tie, Rei still continues to talk like a car mechanic, and behave like a car mechanic, even when inspired to talk about his plans - from the normal road to a new school! And that's all said, and the hall applauds with restraint - there is still a lot of work ahead. \nRei silently surveys the audience, stuttering slightly with excitement, and suddenly\: \n-Thank you. Thank you, compatriots. Only recently you and I struggle together, and today you gave me the right to fight for you. Thank you all! You are the best! \nTears glistened in his eyes. The audience applauds, this time more persistently, pleasantly surprised by such unexpected sincerity. Cries of praise are heard from somewhere. Sweaty but happy, Nashimoto sits down in his place, someone claps him on the shoulder.\n-Well done boy, you have a great future!\nRei feels a glimmer of hope - perhaps in this future, he will be able to be useful not only repairing cars."

Someone even climbed on the telephone pole to get a better view and shouted from his makeshift nest. \n\"Let Hiroshi speak!\" - the commotion from the crowd forces the \"costumes\" to disperse, releasing a man to the platform, who, in principle, was not much different from his flock, except limping, and carried in his flesh shrapnel left from the war. Onori Hiroshi began without preamble\: \n-On this day, we celebrate not only the creation of our union, we celebrate with you finding a new family! We are all a family, from the youngest to the oldest, from a recent immigrant to a native - even you, Sato, are our family, even though you drink like hell! Laughter is heard in the crowd, and Sato himself laughs the most. \n-We are not just defending our rights, we are fighting for our Motherland - we are creating it anew, with our own hands in this hot land! And let the war and tyranny of a handful of \"party\" robbers over working people, as happened in Japan, never happen again. \n-Liar! - an unexpected shout from the crowd caught everyone by surprise, and people were stunned, looking for someone who dared to make such accusations \n-You are a liar! - repeated once again a young man in military uniform without badges. - This man is lying - he is the same dirty communist as those who seized the Motherland! \n-Am I a communist? - Onori blushed, a vein swelled dangerously in his neck. - Am I a communist? \nThe crowd parted as Hiroshi approached the young man. He did not flinch in front of the powerful figure of the worker. \n-Do you see these scars? They were left to me by the war. Where were you while we were fighting the Reds? \n-And you won a lot? With such success, you could stay at home... \nA powerful blow made him sway and retreat to the rock back, pinching his broken nose. At that moment, Hiroshi felt the sting of something sharp and noticed a sword attached to his throat - one of the workers shook his head. \n-Don't touch him, Hiroshi. He is young and stupid. But we have a conversation with you, we, serious people. \n-Hello, Ishujiri, I have nothing to talk about with you. \nOthers joined the swordsman, and soon a circle of gloomy young men formed around them. \n-Shindo Renmei is unhappy with you. \n-Why do I must care about Shindo Renmei? We have a law, it rules, not a handful of fanatics- \n-Don't talk like that, you know perfectly well who you depend on. We may think that you are really a communist. Dissolve it - he pointed to the crowd - and we will disperse peacefully. \n-No. \n-Then it's a war."

And if under other conditions, Sendo-Renmin would have found many supporters, now their moral rightness was not so obvious. The struggle against the trade unionists and the communists is one thing, and the murder of a veteran and a patriot who did not do anything illegal has thrown away from them even the most reactionary circles in politics. Some even say that it is necessary to ban the organization as such - Shindo Renmei has long turned from a defender of the nation into a gang of mobsters."

Nikkei will not be able to move on, as long as the country's internal life is torn by conflicts between the new and the old, between liberalization and conservatism.

The master pressed him to the ground and returned to the frightened students. \n-You are all like Yoshimoto, do not rush to rejoice. - The master paused. - Whoever your parents were, they died with this in their arms. - Ishujiri raised his sword to the light, - but you don't deserve it yet, oh no!

The first are the ones known as 'Meijists', more connected with the post restoration japanese era, who proposes a gothic like palace to be concluded, on a style similar to the Iwate University Department of Agriculture. The second faction are the 'tokugawas', of which prefer a palace similar to the traditional japanese style from the shogunate period, such as the one used on the Kiyomizu-dera temple, and it's more popular because this is the style used on nipo-brazilian architecture.\nThe final suggestion comes from the smaller faction, the 'kofuns', as a result of our investiment on Kofun jidai architecture, a class of Kofun idealizing bureocrats was raised and now are proposing a palace based on the kondō of the Hōryū-ji temple, build in 607, one of the oldest wooden buildings still standing in the world."
