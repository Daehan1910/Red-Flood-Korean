#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
KOR_SETTING_SUN_DESC:0 "일본 제국의 보석인 조선, 혹은 한국은 중대한 식민정책과 산업화 노력의 산물입니다. 하지만 희생이 없진 않습니다. 1919년 만세 '폭동' 이래 조선에서의 독립활동은 점차 커지고 있습니다. 조선 내의 활동가들, 중국 및 만주의 친국민당 유격대가 조선을 쥔 일본의 손아귀를 노리고 있습니다."

POLITICS_Ugaki_Kazushige_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_RHEE_DESC:0 "이승만 박사는 is one of the veterans of the Korean Nationalist movement, he has spent most of his adult life campaigning for it, having built strong ties in America and China to do so. But he is by far one of the most conservative and ruthless of the movement's leaders, leading to his ostracisation by most forward-thinking, moderate and leftist elements. He still keeps the company of the national conservatives, but the influence of Ahn Changho is beginning to outstrip his own."
POLITICS_AHN_DESC:0 "안창호는 명석한 한국계 미국인 기독교인이자 한국 독립운동사의 이정표와 같습니다. One-time president of the provisional government-in-exile, his educated background and connections in America have made him a formidable political leader in the struggle to liberate Korea."
POLITICS_KOO_DESC:0 "호인 \"백범\"으로도 유명한 김구는 has made the independence of a Korean Republic his mission in life, and has stood as vice president of the republic-in-exile for years. One of the leaders of the Donghak Movement and a prominent figure among Korean independence acitivsts since the March 1st Movement, his long career has brought him the respect of his peers in the patriotic groups. His ardent anti-communist stance makes him a polarising figure to some in the fatherland, but his position is also considered too soft by the likes of Syngman Rhee."
POLITICS_YUH_DESC:0 "여운형은 may come from a well-to-do family, but he has been a force for popular democratic left-wing nationalism among Korean independence activists for years. A true believer in the spirit of self-determination and co-operation, he is one of the few in the Korean Republic who do not see the more radical leftist elements in the North as enemies, rather as brothers in the same struggle to unite Korea. Though in the end, he may not get his way, as war between the two sides is highly likely regardless of his soothing words of brotherhood."
POLITICS_CHOE_DESC:0 "최창익은 is among the younger political leaders of the Korean Revolution, having been a student at the time of the March 1st Movement. But all the same he has become a prominent voice among Internationalist circles of the Korean Independence Movement."
POLITICS_CHO_DESC:0 "Mr. Cho commands a great deal of respect among leftists in the Korean Independence Movement. He was arrested in the March 1st crackdowns by the Japanese, but went on to become an important figure in organising people's committees and promoting agricultural programs of self-sufficiency. While his Christian faith is a problem for some among the Korean socialists, he remains an important figure, crucial to the success of a socialist Korea."
POLITICS_KIM_DESC:0 "아나키스트 지도자라는 개념 자체가 형용모순적이라 해도, 김좌진은 만주 남동부의 한인 지역에서 아나키스트 유격대의 수장과 같은 존재가 되었습니다. His arrival in Korea for the revolution signals a shift in intent, having tested the means and methods of Korean anarchism in the countryside borderlands between Mantetsu and Zheltorossiya, the Korean anarchist faction is now a leading component of the revolutionary political scene. Kim has been repeatedly voted as the chairman of the council, making him now the most experienced statesman among them."
POLITICS_PAK_DESC:0 "박헌영은 is seemingly ever-present where the Korean socialist cause is concerned, he has made it his business to be involved in any and all activities that may lead to a communist Korea, right down to helping to organise the Worker's Party in 1925. Despite his relative youth among his peers, he is a senior leader and well read on the German Revolution, having even spent time abroad among Chinese communists during the late 20's. During the early 1930's he has made himself busy with clandestine meetings, arangements and deal brokering between the various socialist movements in Korea, in an attempt to build a coalition that can pose a serious threat to Japanese rule in Korea."
POLITICS_SIN_DESC:0 "1910년대와 20년대, 단재 신채호는 한국 민족주의 조직들의 귀인이었습니다. He advocated for the Korean national and ethnic people viscerally, but this fervour brought him under the close watch of the Japanese authorities. He exiled himself to Manchuria, co-operating with Korean anarchists in the region and formulating his writings into a cogent ideological viewpoint. Today, his ideology is known as Juche, his program of national rebirth and ethnic nationalism under a kind of anarcho-syndicalism has become one of the more popular ideologies in Northern Korea. However, in order to enact his program he must first over come the internal differences in Korea and then the occupying powers in Manchuria. He is by far the most ambitious of Korea's revolutionary leaders, and perhaps the most dangerous too, the bounty on his head is considerable even to this day."

kor.1.d:0 "마침내 태어난 대한민국에서 옛 양반들은 독 안에 든 쥐 꼴이 되고 말았습니다. 혁명분자들이 반동의 피를 부르짖는 한편, 일본은 양반들을 자기네 화족으로 대체하려 하고, 공화파는 이들의 특권을 모두 빼앗으려 합니다. 선택지들 가운데 공화파가 최소한 안전을 보장한 한편, 일본은 자기네 땅에서 벌어지는 문제에 급급한 데다, 특히 향촌에서 한국인들을 상대로 벌이고 있다는 대규모 억압으로 인해 믿을 만한 친구가 되기 어렵습니다."

kor.2.t:0 "Making the best of the worst"
kor.2.d:0 "It could not possibly be clearer to anyone that the era of Japanese imperialism is nearing its end, or at least its crescendo. Ever since the March 1st incident of 1919, the grip of the Japanese on Korea has severely weakened, and resistance to occupation has been ramping up in the last four years. The prevailing belief in Japan is that Japan must either cede to the demands of the Koreans, or brace for colonial revolt. This is obviously the worst-case scenario, seeing as republican, socialist, and anarchist movements are alive and well in China and Manchuria, and would surely take such an opportunity to strike against our government in Manchuria, aided by Chinese nationalists as well as the Zhili clique.\nAll of the struggles of Japan’s foreign policy have thrown Japan’s domestic politics completely out of balance, to the point of turning Japan from an up-and-coming empire into a crippled nation ripe for Communist revolution. As Japan careens into an uncertain era, it is up to the colonial government to try and steer the Korea as best it can in the right direction, and it is up to the Revolutionaries and Republicans to find a way to unify so that they may finally end the Sick Man of Asia's grip on their country."

While women in Japan are not exactly equal with their male counterparts in the eyes of the law, the position of Korean women is even less so. Korean women are often assigned to Japanese soldiers as “comfort women”, which is basically a form of involuntary prostitution. This has become the main focus of the women’s rights debate, as even the most chauvinistic among the Japanese ruling class have come to see this system as somewhat brutal. Another issue which is emerging from the Diet’s more progressive members is allowing women into the workforce. While this idea is strongly opposed by the vast majority of those who believe in Japanese traditional society, the idea of doubling the workforce in both Korea and Japan, effectively doubling industrial productivity, is attractive on a practical level.

kor.4.d:0 "As is the case in most colonial empires, one of the biggest problems that colonised nations face is the erasure of their native culture by their overlord. This is precisely why Prince Yi Un has decided to pre-empt the erasure of his culture, and by extension his claim to the throne of Korea, by petitioning the Japanese government to ensure that Korean culture is safeguarded by a new Cultural Preservation Program in the peninsula. Korea has already been affected by Japanese cultural imperialism to some degree, with mass proliferation of Japanese language texts in Korea, as well as all official documents being printed in Japanese. However, the relatively weak presence of the Japanese in Korea seems to have all but halted the process of Nihonisation, at least for now. Regardless, the Korean Prince still sees the looming threat of Korean destruction as one to be taken seriously, and is not backing down on this issue. The Korean exiles in other nations, such as Republicans in China and even the Anarchists and Councilists in Manchuria, have praised Prince Yi’s stalwart defense of his nation, even under the boot of imperialism. Most of the native population, on the other hand, has been silent, either out of disinterest in high-minded politics or a fear of retribution from Japanese authorities. Japan is now left with a decision to make; give their subjects what they want, or face the potentially revolutionary consequences."

This week’s screaming match is over Japan’s plans for Korean industrialization. On one hand, the Korean economy is in poor shape. Much of the country is still very rural, with many Korean farmers still having not moved beyond subsistence agriculture. On the other, however, the present colonial status quo has already uprooted the lives of many Koreans, and they would surely not respond well to more aggressive policies. Although many politicians are dedicated to defending their positions and ideals, many burned out ministers are simply desperate for some kind of consensus and an end to the constant bickering.

kor.6.d:0 "Since the colonization of Korea in 1910, land ownership has been exclusively available to Japanese colonists, creating a strong class divide between the landowning Japanese and the peasant farmers of Korea. However, some of these peasant farmers have been fortunate enough to accumulate their own wealth, and now seek to become landowners themselves. The government in Korea is deeply opposed to this idea, given that a vast majority of politicians in Korea are Japanese landowners themselves. However, as the ties between Japan and the crown jewel of her empire become more and more frayed, it is being increasingly seen as an alternative to outright Korean revolt. There is no doubt among the ruling government that the Koreans are almost unanimous in their support of this legislation, and to block it would alienate the entirety of the colony’s native population. However, some of the more hardline aristocrats see the risk as worth taking, if it means defending the status quo that they have worked so hard to maintain for the past two and a half decades. After much debate over the pragmatism of avoiding open rebellion versus the idealist principles of the colonists, the government has finally decided…"

The opposition has rationalized that increasing migration to Korea will be seen as an aggressive move by the native population, who will turn against their overlords even more than they already have. However, those in favor argue that Korea’s issue is not with dissatisfaction, but uncivilization. By observing the examples of noble Japanese colonists, the Korean people would learn to respect their betters and mind themselves.

There is now a coalition in Korea itself which seeks to establish socialism and fights against the Imperial Loyalists in the North and is sizing up their rival republicans in the South. These radical republicans consist of communists, socialists, as well as fellow anarchists who have allied together in the hopes of finding a place for themselves in the new revolutionary era. The KPAM has enthusiastically committed to sending their militias to assist the communist-led forces, but some wonder whether this is truly a wise decision, as history has shown that Marxists and Anarchists do not always tend to find much common ground. Some, on the other hand, are suggesting that this is the beginning of the true anarchist revolution for which they have been waiting, and have called to disband the KPAM in order to totally commit to this conflict.

Stray shells peppered the remaining combatants along the 'frontlines' (chiefly foxholes and grenade craters). After more than a day of fighting the Army cleared the area and the Koreans retreated.
