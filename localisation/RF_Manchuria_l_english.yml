man.1.d:0 "With Revolutionary forces quickly overrunning loyalist forces, and the fall of the capital, the Imperial family has seen fit to flee the country to escape persecution at the hands of socialist forces. The governors in the former dominion of Manchuria have welcomed them, as they docked in Dalian aboard an unassuming ship. Not only do the family seek to preserve their lives, but to also form an imperial government in exile to oppose the revolution which has bloodily seized Japan."

man.15.d:0 "While the IJA retreats and attempts to quell the revolution, the Kwantung forces in Manchuria watch nervously as the Beiyang Armies regroup. The peace treaty covers the colony for a year but bandits an worse are still rife. Beiyang must be watched, lest they attempt to crush the colony."
man.15.a:0 "Man the border, they cannot be trusted."

man.16.t:0 "만주의 미래"
man.16.d:0 "The future of Manchuria hangs in the balance, the volatile situation in the colony is deteriorating, increased Chinese military activity is building concerns of a Fengtian threat.

man.19.d:0 "The military takeover is complete, yet the Chinese persist. There is now a serious Fengtian force massing near Mukden, the Kwantung Army is not in position and the garrison is under-supplied. Should they take the city the colony will effectively cease to exist, Shinkyo and Jinzhou are already cut off by bandits. The crisis has arrived, Mantetsu's end is nigh."

man.20.t:0 "화족의 지위"
man.20.d:0 "Many of the Japanese aristocracy have sought solace and refuge in Manchuria, the problem now is whether to maintain their status. As Japanese citizens they already enjoy many privileges, but are destitute in comparison to their lavish lifestyles in the home islands. The petitions are now daily, with tithes and bribes becoming widespread. We must decide how to proceed, do we maintain the aristocracy, strip it of power but maintain special status, or eliminate their privliges altogether?"
man.20.a:0 "Maintain their position."
man.20.b:0 "Do away with these titles."
man.20.c:0 "Let them keep the titles but strip their powers."

man.21.t:0 "만주인들의 지위"
man.21.d:0 "There have been repeated suggestions and initiatives to involve the native Manchurians in government and military matters as a means of legitimising our rule of the region. By exaggerating ethnic tensions between the Chinese poeple's and involving the North's natives we can build a stronger base of support, but risk losing control of certain departments to nativist opposition. The alternative is far less savoury but would guarantee loyalties with an all-japanese staff. Of course the ever-present ideas of a reformist compromise linger as a potential solution, with a promotion of Manchu culutre and language ahead of Han Chinese presenting an opportunity to build a 5th column within the Chinese."

man.22.t:0 "노구교 사건" #usurping the BYJ
man.22.d:0 "How hard could it be to provoke a warlord into rash action? Not hard at all, it seems. The mutual distrust between Fengtian and Shanxi has resulted in a prime opportunity to instigate a coup. Through cunning and guile Fengtian troops have been permitted passage into Beijing to guard a party of officials, they arrived to settle a trade dispute, but little did they know they were part of a bigger design. Once the Fengtian entourage crossed the Marco Polo Bridge, a bomb was detonated, obviously the Shanxi had attacked Fengtian troops and officials on a diplomatic mission. Outrageous! With confusion in the Shanxi ranks, several Fengtian divisions mobilised and entered Beijing as a relief force. The ensuing fight quickly descended into a siege with the Shanxi officials as hostages. The outcome remains unclear, a war to enact vengeance could be called, or the young marshal could rally a diplomatic response and force the many bickering Beiyang Generals to abandon the Shanxi for the Fengtian. If the coup works, the Fengtian would become the dominant force in the North."
man.22.a:0 "전쟁 선포."

man.23.t:0 "The Failing Fugu Plan"
man.23.d:0 "At its conception the Fugu Plan was a wild venture, importing jews from various parts of Russia and Asia to join a fledgling Jewish colony in Manchuria sounds like a pipedream. Nontheless the Japanese authroities had committed to the plan, now however, with their grip on the colony slipping away, the Jews in Sunkiang have petitioned the Russian Republic for aid."
man.23.a:0 "So much for that."

man.24.t:0 "개들을 위한 산문"
man.24.d:0 "The notorious Zhang Zongchang is once more afoot in Northern China. His house arrest in Qingdao was rudely interrupted by the tumult of the Sunset Crash and its aftermath. Now that Zuolin has recalled the Monster of Shandong to service in Shenyang, the infamous General has once more taken to his opulent lifestyle and unorthodox pastimes. Perhaps most innocuous amongst his habits is his “talent” for prose. Yet this still has managed to cause a stir, while the Old Marshal cannot read and outright refuses to learn, Zongchang’s written word has been attracting attention. French observers and journalists in Shanghai have reportedly taken a liking to his works, resulting in a prominent French businessman sponsoring Zongchang’s entry into an international futurist poetry duel in Le Soleil. The Russian maester of Zaum Velimir Khlebnikov is tipped to win the contest, but the exceedingly vulgar and violent nature of Zongchang and his work is turning heads. Should Zongchang win the duel it would cause much upset across the futurist world. Should he be allowed to attend?"
man.24.a:0 "어이 없는 요구로군!"
man.24.b:0 "좋아, 놔줘서 한두 주간 딴 놈들을 괴롭게 해주자고."

man.241.t:0 "르 솔레유에서의 한 주"
man.241.d:0 "The arrival of the Dogmeat General’s entourage into Le Soleil was a sight to behold, more than a dozen cars and several luggage cases brimming with who-knows-what strapped to their roofs. The General wasted no time taking in the sights and pleasures of Le Soleil with his concubines and retinue. After a tour of the city, including the new le musée d'art futuriste, he and his party occupied a theatre in the old Île de la Cité. Several party-goers reported high-level French officials enthusiastically partaking in heavy opium smoking and dancing with Zhang’s women. Before long - they say - the General retired to a French brothel for the night, hiring the entire establishment for himself and his party. This typified his week.\nOn the morning of the duel he was found in a spa on the outskirts of the city, nursing a severe hangover and surrounded by French escorts.\nFor all his decadence he was surprisingly lucid during the duel itself, his uniform was pristine too, as translators scrambled to reconstruct Khlebnikov’s verses into Russian, then French, then finally Chinese, Zhang stood smiling and smoking a comically large cigar.\nWhen his parry came it was brutal, efficient and yet deft. The French observers choked on their laughter, the retort which would later be titled “A severe burn” appeared to flumox Khlebnikov. Who attempted to continue combat before stammering on his final line. Zhang’s reply was a killing blow - “This skinny shit is wasting time, he is but a little man with a little cock, end this parade so I can fuck some more.”\n“Such a man!”\n“So powerful.”\n“He pushes the boundaries with every line.”\n“Velimir never stood a chance against his manhood.”\nThe celebrations of his victory lasted the weekend, and quotations headlined the Le Soleil morning editions of Le Jet de Sang. By the time he set about leaving the city he had become a French celebrity. His last words before boarding his plane were “I’ll be back, first I have to go kill some bastard communists at home.”"
