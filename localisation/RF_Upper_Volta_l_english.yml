#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
#IDEAS#
UPV_naive_politics:0 "순진한 정치체제"
UPV_naive_politics_desc:0 "Pretty much every single one of our intellectuals and government ministers, along with our President, are all extremely young compared to other world leaders, with some of them being as young as 18. This results in an idealistic high society, filled with big dreams for an utopian-democratic Upper Volta. However, this does make us more vulnerable to the Military and Monarchist elements."
UPV_christian_government:0 "기독교 주도 정부"
UPV_christian_government_desc:0 "Every single high profile person in Upper Volta is a Christian, with Muslims in the north of the country generally having very little political power. This results in various problems, including one of insurgencies in places near Mauritania or the border with France, along with a quiet political unrest even in the fertile south of the country."

upv.1.title:0 "1936년의 오트볼타"
upv.1.desc:0 "Born from a coup by Nazi Boni against the rump Colonial authorities, the Republic of Upper Volta is a fledging pluralistic democracy, in fact, the only real Democracy in Africa in 1936. No other country in Africa is an independently-aligned, free democracy - and this places us in a dangerous situation.\n\nAcross our borders exist military dicatorships, Futurist colonial authority, British-aligned \"Democracies\", and total anarchy to our East. Our naive yet beautiful democracy rose from misery and backwardsness as the Christian intellectuals of Ouagadougou comprise our political establishment, slowly creating it from the ground up through advertising, politicking, and campaigns across the nation. Despite the immense Francophilia surrounding our politics, our nation is overwhelmingly anti-Accelerationist and there are no relevant politicians which advocate for the French model, paradoxically so to some.\n\nIn our two years of existence, no Constitution has been signed, partly due to the bickering of various political parties and also due to the state of Emergency we are in - but things have seemed to calm down - as we reach a New Year, and celebrations close as Ouagadougou begins a new dawn - a new shining light in Upper Voltan history."
upv.1.a:0 "Every birth is the rebirth of an ancestor."
upv.2.title:0 "제헌"
upv.2.desc:0 "Our population has been anxious for this moment for a long time now.\n\nNot only is drafting a Constitution critical to protecting our democracy, it is key to maintaining it's legitimacy to the people. Our first and most urgent question is that of Religion - which are our recognized religions, and how far should we go in protecting the rights of religious traditions, along with newer religions, in Burkina Faso? The UDIVH has completely split up on the issue, along with several other hot-button problems, which have created several split parties to the UDIVH, with only the Conservative wing remaining as a rump, albeit quite a powerful one still. Not only is applying our recognized religions constitutionally going to either cutoff certain groups from having citizenship - and thus ability to vote - it will also determine how stable will be our politics, considering that most of the population is Muslim, resulting in a large amount of Sufi Muslim resentment towards our Government regardless of what we do - yet, at the same time, giving them too much power might be what destroys our democracy in the first place. The parties have voted, and the issues grow further as we will need to move on to other problems as fast as possible. The Upper House has agreed that..."
upv.2.a:0 "Christianity, Islam, and African traditional religions."
upv.2.b:0 "Christianity only."
upv.2.c:0 "Christianity and Sufi Islam."
upv.2.d:0 "Give no religion official status."
upv.3.title:0 "제헌 - 지위"
upv.3.desc:0 "Our nation is a bit... Artificial so to speak - as it's name is a mere location name, and our peoples are extremely diverse, resulting in a pluronational state. However, is that what we want? The Military has stated that only the Mossi people should be recognized as the \"National ethnicity\", and seek to maintain a Mossi-only state as other cultures get assimilated into a larger Upper-Voltan superculture. Nazi Boni's clique disagrees, believing that the future is of a fully westernized, civic nationalist Upper Volta where anyone can become a citizen - with no cultural or ethnic privileges given to any group. Joseph Conombo and his alliance generally believes that every Christian culture in Upper Volta should have rights of recognition, while Diongolo Traoré's clique believes that the country should generally allow autonomy to every ethnicity, but generally seek to assimilate slowly and freely to the Franco-Mossi culture, resulting in a more moderate civic nationalism compared to Boni. What shall be decided? The Upper House says that..."
upv.3.a:0 "A Plurinational State is the future."
upv.3.b:0 "Only Christian ethnicities deserve privileges."
upv.3.c:0 "French unites us."
upv.3.d:0 "No one except the Mossi belong to this land."
upv.4.title:0 "제헌 - 언어"
upv.4.desc:0 "Despite the immense Francophilia of Ouagadougou and of the local intellectuals, it appears that most of the populace speaks French either poorly or not at all - and, with this issue, comes the question of which languages should be official in Upper Volta. The Conservatives believe that, generally, French should be the sole official language, but autonomy should be given to schools to teach any language they wish. While the Military agrees on French being the official language, they believe that French should be the only taught language for the sake of National Unity. Nazi Boni's clique believes that generally most large languages should become official, while French becomes a lingua franca for unity amongst other languages and tourists, basically being a more moderate choice. Traoré and his friends believe that English and French should be the official languages - being the most outrageous proposal of them all - but it is argued that English is the World's Language, and thusly should be used in Upper Volta aswell so it continues to catch up with the rest of the World. It is also important to note aswell that this is the final section of the Constitution regarding issues which not every party agrees on. It is expected, then, that a snap election will occur after Nazi Boni and the Upper Parliament signs the Constitution. And so, it was decided..."
upv.4.a:0 "French is our Lingua Franca for unity."
upv.4.b:0 "French is official, but one can learn other languages too."
upv.4.c:0 "French and English shall be the languages of the future!"
upv.4.d:0 "Every single Upper Voltan will learn French for unity of Nation!"
upv.5.title:0 "1936 Snap Elections"
upv.5.desc:0 "After the 1936 Constitution has been finished, Nazi Boni declared a snap election due to the new situation around the country, and subsequently the importance of exercising Democracy in a democratic nation. Thusly, people across Upper Volta began to vote for the first time in their lives, seeing the performance of various parties and subsequently how well they looked to the general public, especially the major city of Ouagadougou. And so, after counting all the ballots, the result is..."
upv.5.a:0 "나지 보니의 MPA wins triumphantly!"
upv.5.b:0 "UDIHV 잔존당이 surprises everyone with a victory!"
upv.5.c:0 "AJIS가 wins the heart of Ouagadougou!"
upv.5.d:0 "The Military's party scrapes a victory!"
upv.5.e:0 "The PRA wins an upset victory!"
