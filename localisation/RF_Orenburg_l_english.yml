#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
ORE_DESC_MENU:0 "내전의 발발은 군사지구 체제가 너무나 비효율적임을 모든 정당들 앞에 보여주었습니다. 알렉산드르 두토프와 그의 카자키 자치대가 이끄는 오렌부르크 군사지구는 이런 상황 속에서 태어났습니다. 중립을 유지했어야 했을 두토프는 분쟁 당시 콜차크에게 자신의 몫을 걸었습니다. 카자흐 시위가 진압된 이후 알라쉬 정당들은 대놓고 두토프에 반대하기 시작했습니다. 1932년과 33년의 기근이 친공산주의 향민 봉기로 이어지며 상황은 악화됐습니다. 오렌부르크 군사지구의 동란은 대체로 끝난 듯해도, 오렌부르크 위로 날아들 독수리들이 모습을 드러낼진 지켜볼 일입니다."
POLITICS_ALEX_DUTOV_DESC:0 "알렉산드르 두토프가 가진 풍부한 카자크 연대 지휘 경험은 오렌부르크 카자키 통치에 필요한 재주를 그에게 주었습니다. 두토프의 업무는 두 가지입니다. 오렌부르크 영토를 러시아의 통제하에 두고, 그에 맞서는 이는 모두 죽이는 것. 단련된 러시아 군인으로서, 두토프는 두 직무를 기꺼이 수행해내고 있습니다."

ore.1.d:0 "\"일리치, 편지 왔습니다.\" 올려다 본 두토프는 감사를 표하며 taking the wrinkled envelope from his hands. 오렌부르크의 지도자로 재직하는 동안 두토프는 긍정되거나 부정된 내용을 담은 상당량의 편지들을 받아봤습니다. 편지에 무슨 내용이 담겼는가를 맞혀 보는 건 항상 흥미진진한 놀라움이었습니다. 두토프는 긍정된 내용의 편지를 더 좋아했지만, 빠르게 훑어본 내용은 편지가 후자의 유형임을 내보였습니다. \n\n\"dishonorable 알렉산드르 일리치 두토프에게, 네놈의 장기가 네 몸 속에서 썩어가길. 러시아국의 폭압이 너무나 오랫동안 카자흐인들과 노동자, 그리고 수많는 이들을 짓눌렀지만 너는 채찍을 쥔 손으로 우리를 대했다. 악의 현현인 네놈은 모스크바에 있는 네 인향술사에게만 복종할 뿐. You are an agent of oppression enforcing an unjust hierarchy onto all peoples under your boot, and I cannot wait until the day your rule comes crumbling down and your corpse is dragged through the streets.\" \n\nAs Dutov finished reading through the verbal assault, 편지를 구기곤 집어던졌습니다. He was no stranger to demeaning messages, and each time the small sting grew less and less. At this point they had almost no effect on the man, for it was so normalized in his psyche. 한 명의 분노가 잠을 설칠 거리가 되진 않았습니다. 어쨌거나..."

ore.2.d:0 "알렉세이 이바노비치 됴민은 shifted his coat, the sweat seeping through despite the light smattering of snow falling from above. Ataman Dutov's speech infront of Orenburg was very important, especially in these turbulent times. This meant that his job as bodyguard was invaluable now more than ever, which lead to frustrations when Dutov wished to have his guard stand in the background of the stage, in order to promote a more \"peaceful and welcoming\" feeling for the crowd. His foolish wish to appeal to the common man was a huge breach of security protocols, but 알렉세이는 상관의 직할명령에 불복하고 싶진 않았습니다. \n\nAs the speech started, Alexei tried to ponder ways in which he could still protect the Ataman in a way that would be more discrete than usual, even if it had the downside of making Dutov appear more vulnerable. After a short period of deliberation, he realized he could attempt to blend into the crowd, and although he would be abandoning his post in technicality, he felt that the safety of the Ataman stood at a higher priority than simple orders. With his mind made up, Alexei chose to..."

ore.6.d:0 "때마다 알렉세이는 군중을 살펴보았습니다. 특별히 움직이던 것도 없었고, 누구도 수상하게 굴지 않았으며, 눈에는 눈물이 고이기 시작했습니다. 더 나은 감시를 위해 최소한의 깜빡임만 유지하던 비인간적 행동의 결과였습니다. 차가운 바람이 그의 동공에 눈을 쏟고 얼굴의 땀은 얼어붙은 것이, 마치 하느님께서 아무것도 아닌 일로 알렉세이를 시험하시는 듯했습니다. 아무 일도 벌어지지 않았고, 아무 일도 벌어지지 않을 것입니다. 이번 행사는 평화로울 것이라던 두토프가 옳다는 생각과 함께, 알렉세이는 다시 눈을 깜빡였습니다. \n\n그러나 눈을 뜬 알렉세이에게 보인 건 반사의 반짝임이 외피 속으로 사라지는 모습이었습니다. 총이었을까요? 커다랗게 뜬 그의 눈은 focused solely on the man awkwardly shuffling around with his pockets, his suspicions mounted tenfold when the man started walking towards the stage. 사내는 알렉세이의 얼어붙은 초병에게 시선을 고정하고선 순식간에 무대를 향해 달려들었습니다.\n\n\"일리치!\" 알렉세이가 전력으로 질주하며 소리쳤습니다. \"숙여요!\" The man leaped onstage, brandishing a grenade with the pin already pulled. In a split second deliberation, Alexei knew what must be done, and as he tackled the suicide bomber to the floor, he let his eyes rest one final time, safe with the fact that his job had been fulfilled."

ore.7.t:0 "평화로운 눈밭에서"
ore.7.d:0 "As Alexei weaved through the dense crowd, doubts raced across his mind, doubts which he quickly snuffed as simple paranoia induced by stress. He had a job to do which required his upmost attention, and any distractions would be disasterous to the safety of the Ataman, and thus the nation of Orenburg as a whole. He alone stood between Hell and Heaven, as the guardian of life and death. \n\nAlexei's slow shuffle through the powdersnow was impeded by the jostling of the crowd, and more often than once he had been blocked from any movement for precious seconds, a risk that he could not afford to take. As he continued surveying the area, he noticed a man infront of him check over his shoulder before moving towards the stage. Alexei, the vigilant guardian he was, flung himself forward, engaging the mystery man in a chase. The Ataman's face was surprised at this disturbance, and when he turned around to find Alexei missing, his fate was already sealed. \n\nThe man lept onto the stage and into Dutov, before a blinding explosion with the brightness of the Sun threw shrapnel across the crowd. Alexei fell face-down into the same soft snow that had kept him still, his conciousness knocked out from him. The bloody pulp that used to lead Orenburg sizzled, as the snow kept falling as though nothing had happened."

ore.4.d:0 "두토프 장군이 사망하고 그가 가장 두려워하던 일이 벌이지고 말았습니다. 도시이자 지구로서의 오렌부르크가 혼돈에 휩싸인 것입니다. A chain of explosions rattled the city early this morning with a series of massive hollow booms, and bands of Kazakh partisans, pre-positioned in workhouses and factory dormitories or packed into leased-out flophouses, flooded out into the city. 일부 집단은 간신히 진압됐지만, 다른 무리는 도시를 돌파하고 벽촌을 포위하며 전략거점을 점령하는 등 훈련의 분명한 기미와 함께 통일된 무기체계를 보였습니다. 반군과 준군사 경찰대가 주고받는 총성이 오렌부르크 전역에서 메아리쳤습니다. The citizens have vanished, huddling in their homes and hoping to avoid stray bullets, or else hunkering down with what arms they possess to defend their own property. However, something is amiss in this attempt at a while coup. Messages have gone out, missives dispatched by an anonymous writer claiming to be a general officer of the Orenburg Russian Army, to the garrisons surrounding the city. The missives order the troops to assemble and immediately march on critical positions, doubtlessly putting them into direct conflict with the rebels. But with the source of these missives unknown and their authority dubious at best, the officers are quarreling over the proper response. It remains to be seen how many, if any, of the garrison commanders will march If enough of them move quickly, their regular troops will no doubt crush the irregular partisans. A partial or piecemeal response from the army will likely hand victory to the rebels and traitors - but with Dutov dead and Orenburg in chaos, it is a mystery who would have both the means and motive to arrange the failure of the revolt."

We theorize that they couldn't have acted alone: someone supported them from the inside. I'm afraid it is very likely that General Lavr Kornilov is our leading suspect. Confidential sources tell me that he remains sympathetic to democracy, so it is very likely that could be undermining the authority of the other generals to restore the Republic. I hope your Excellency takes this evidence with the most absolute seriousness. The future of Russia depends on it.” -Alexander Dutov"

Orenburg_find_the_source_desc:0 "Who was it that tried to kill him? Dutov's memories of the attack were still hazy. He has many enemies, and any of them could benefit from his death. Of course, one of the other Russian warlords was unlikely: as a possible ally, he was more useful alive than dead. The attack was dirty and improvised, the sort of amateur effort an anarchist might attempt. The Kazakh Separatists were the obvious first suspect - he was going to order his men to sweep every corner of his domain to find the attacker. Even if he had to upturn all of Orenburg in the process."

Much of the machinery had grown worn and outdated in the chaos of the Revolution and the malaise that followed, and perennial corruption cut into both profits and investment budgets. If Dutov was to salvage the situation, no part of the industrial network could be left untouched. He'd need to build new factories, assemble new machines, punish the corrupt, and even find ways to encourage the workers to put in some actual effort."

However, the lack of funding rendered it impossible to implement all the necessary programs to transform a corrupt band of misfits into a professional fighting force. Getting money from Kolchak was out of the question, so the only ones capable of funding such a project were the Orenburg bourgeoisie. But given what the Orenburg elite owe to Dutov's government for protecting them from socialists and keeping order in their factories, a bit of low-cost financing should be trivial to acquire."

Orenburg_responsible_government:0 "책임정부"
Orenburg_responsible_government_desc:0 "Guaranteeing the freedom of our citizens is insufficient; we also have to ensure that those in power cannot abuse it to serve their own ends. A bureaucratic self-cleansing apparatus is necessary to keep the rotten fruits away from the state apparatus."

Orenburg_between_europa_and_asia_desc:0 "Uniting the different cultures of the old Russian Empire is just the first step in our goals. Our new identity must eliminate the artificial lines between Europe and Asia by considering both of them as one: Eurasia. Both Peter the Great and Genghis Khan are part of the same history; the Volga and the Amur are part of the same territory. That's why our efforts we'll be focused on how connected the history and culture of Europe and Asia are."

And even now, they could be planning their next move, while Dutov is focused on a pointless quest. Some reactionary officers inside the Orenburg garrison see this as an opportunity to kill any individuals they consider to be leftists or rebels. The warlord has chosen to give them permission to arrest or execute (and anything else, as they see fit) everyone suspected of trying to undermine his authority. The attacker was surely one of his enemies, so physically removing all of them would surely eliminate the culprit as well."

Of the army budget, a fifth is dedicated to buying alcohol and fifteen percent is wasted on cleaning the resulting mess. And most outrageously: ten percent of it just disappears into thin air! There is much to be done to improve the performance of the Orenburg Army. Purging inadequate officers, replacing obsolete equipment, reorganizing units, drafting superior battle plans, and preparing to manage rebellion."

What better way to stimulate investment in the heavy industrial sector than outfitting the army with modern tanks? The Cossacks might not be completely trustworthy, but most of them were loyal to something like Russia, and they were certainly competent soldiers. Horses were increasingly obsolete, but the missions of the cavalry remained - how better to keep his own Cossacks effective than by mounting them on iron horses? "

When he eventually woke, he found another letter on his desk, addressed to him. How the letter found its way there was unclear. Maybe his aide didn't want to ruin his sleep? Was another rebel trying to intimidate him? Dutov read the envelope: General Mikhail Drozdovsky. “I wonder what the general wants. It can't be to wish me a full recovery” Dutov thought, once again grabbing his letter opener..."
