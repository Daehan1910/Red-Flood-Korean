#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_Konstantin_Petrovich_Nechaev_DESC:0 "콘스탄틴 페트로비치 네차예프는 군사독재자의 자리를 향한 길고 위험한 길을 거친 끝에 잠무-카쉬미르의 여지 없는 통치자가 되었습니다. 본디 러시아 제국육군의 장교였던 네차예프가 it wasnt long until he and his band of merry men defected to the other side of the gun barrel in Harbin. It would be pointless trying to add some ideological or moral justification to that decision however, as Konstantin eventually found service under various militias and companies that had enough to spare to fund his presence. Seeing great opportunity in the ongoing conflict in China, he and his mercenary following amassed from spoils of war soon discovered a great ally in the late warlord Yan Xishan who had need for every man in the struggle against Zhang Zuolin. The Russians proved themselves useful, bringing Yan closer to his eventual takeover of the Beiyang government. Such effort shouldnt go unrewarded, but Konstantin had a more valuable offer than a warm spot in the republics bureocracy. Bidding Yan Xishan farewell, he left all the way through Asia for the Princely state of Jammu Kashmir. Seeing how weak the Princes authority was after the withdrawal of british force, the mercenaries faced little opposition in claiming the land as their own. Now with Kashmir under his firm control, Konstantin hopes to further his need for wealth and glory through any (albeit lot of times questionable) means. After all why not? It doesnt look like anyone who could ruin his little bandit kingdom will be showing up soon. Externally that is..."

RAJ_shared_economy_desc:0 "영국령 인도의 붕괴로, 옛 라자를 대체한 분열되고 군벌이 된 토후국들은 혼돈과 투립을 인도의 지배자 자리에 올려놓았습니다. 기아, 질병, 분쟁과 무정부가 도전에 뛰어들 군을 불러모으게 합니다."
