#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_Konstantin_Petrovich_Nechaev_DESC:0 "칸스탄틴 피트라비치 니차이프는 군사독재자의 자리를 향한 길고 위험한 길을 거친 끝에 잠무-카쉬미르의 여지 없는 통치자가 되었습니다. 본디 러시아 제국육군의 장교였던 니차이프가 it wasnt long until he and his band of merry men defected to the other side of the gun barrel in Harbin. It would be pointless trying to add some ideological or moral justification to that decision however, as Konstantin eventually found service under various militias and companies that had enough to spare to fund his presence. Seeing great opportunity in the ongoing conflict in China, he and his mercenary following amassed from spoils of war soon discovered a great ally in the late warlord Yan Xishan who had need for every man in the struggle against Zhang Zuolin. The Russians proved themselves useful, bringing Yan closer to his eventual takeover of the Beiyang government. Such effort shouldnt go unrewarded, but Konstantin had a more valuable offer than a warm spot in the republics bureocracy. Bidding Yan Xishan farewell, he left all the way through Asia for the Princely state of Jammu Kashmir. Seeing how weak the Princes authority was after the withdrawal of british force, the mercenaries faced little opposition in claiming the land as their own. Now with Kashmir under his firm control, Konstantin hopes to further his need for wealth and glory through any (albeit lot of times questionable) means. After all why not? It doesnt look like anyone who could ruin his little bandit kingdom will be showing up soon. Externally that is..."
