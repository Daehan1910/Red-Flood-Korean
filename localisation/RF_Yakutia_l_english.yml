kck.1.title:0 "한 제독의 삶"
kck.1.desc:0 "It was another freezing day all across the rump Far-Eastern General Governorate, as new investors come in through the port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and arrive in Yakutsk to discuss business. People played in the streets, some sang, some sold things. Things appeared good, until it seemed something was wrong. Very wrong. The Yakut workers across Yakutsk began to stop working; it almost felt like a subconscious movement that spanned every Yakut and other opressed group within the Governorate. But it was not subconscious; they had been planning this revolt for months, and it seemed like the most likely to succeed. Regardless, if it did not, dying for the dream of a free Yakutia is better than living under Russia, in the eyes of many. As this strike occured, it appeared that thousands of Yakuts began marching towards Yakutsk, the capital of the Governorate, and proclaimed in Russian and Yakut \"No more!\", resulting in massive, brutal response by the local police. However, the Yakuts, with their fighting and hunting experience, began to force the Russian police away from them. As they continued to march on the capital of Yakutsk, more reinforcements arrived from the northern areas, as more Russian officers came to the aid of their policemen. This revolt wasn't like the others. Regardless, the Yakut National Congress began to speak in front of a podium a few streets across from the Capital Building, and proclaimed that Yakutia would become a free nation opposed to Russian imperialism. Ksenofontov, aware of what is going on, quickly gets to work in keeping the act of neutrality, whilst Russian officers continue to attack violently against the Yakuts. Eventually, one group manages to win out, when..."
kck.1.a:0 "Ksenofontov gives the rebels a leader!"
kck.1.b:0 "Russian police supress the rebellion!"
kck.1.c:0 "The Yakuts win out with Japanese aid!"
kck.2.title:0 "자유 야쿠티야 건설"
kck.2.desc:0 "Delegates from all over the cold and unforgiving land of Yakutia have come together in a single building located in Aldan, as an attempt to not centralize power in any particular city. Regardless, Ksenofontov couldn't spend all his time thinking about city choice for Constitutional matters. What mattered now was to secure a democratic and free future for all Yakutians. With a delegation of 2,431 members, 1,062 of whom being from local non-Slavic groups such as the Tungids. However, the rest of the groups are mostly Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, etc. Who were either forcibly settled or settled for opportunity. There is also one Permanent Japanese, American, and British delegate in the Constitution, a move considered controversial. Regardless, the constitutional convention continued as usual, with Ksenofontov leading the efforts to secure democratic policies and ensuring a balance between the Tungus peoples and the Slavs, alongside encouraging American and British investors to strengthen Yakutia's economy as a resource powerhouse. After 14 long hours of discussion, the Republic of Yakutia's constitution had been created, a land made for all to come and live freely, a land of true liberty and idealism."
kck.2.a:0 "May liberty shine forever in these cold lands."
kck.4.title:0 "Klondike of Japan"
kck.4.desc:0 "Kurihara was tired. He, depressed and anxious, afraid of military service, and scared of the expectations placed on him, was sick of being poor in every facet of life. He wanted opportunity. One day he was drinking sake and looking outside his home in Nagasaki, when he kept researching across Japan for ways to avoid military service, which in his eyes would ruin his already fragile emotional and mental state. So, he began to develop connections. Psychologists, military-experienced people, all kinds of people as he began to get the latest news in Japanese politics. Then, he heard of an excursion of 200 Japanese officers to Yakuti... Yakutia? What are they doing in Russia again? \n \"Last time this happened, it didn't go well for us\", he thought. Yet, it felt like opportunity. He kept an eye on it. After a couple of weeks, he'd heard that the Japanese officers had successfully declared the independence of the Yakut people. This meant that it was, as he knew, a client state of Japan. It still didn't feel like enough to be a possible evasion; his dread increased. Yet, he'd heard of gold and other resources' mining in the area. Knowing this would be a good chance to work for the Government, Kurihara began to look into migration possibilities as an investor. Then, he began hearing of more stories, so many stories of people finding immense amounts of gold in undeveloped areas; it felt like he, himself, had struck gold in many ways. He began to pack his things, stopped paying rent, and went to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, slowly driving by taxi towards Okhotsk, and so, he began his ultimate attempt at success in life. He was there early, there weren't many Japanese mining in the area, but enough to have caused news in the homeland. He began to work as an independent miner, officially a \"Assistance Development Team Member\", finding immense quantities of gold never touched by man before. And like that, in the golden rocks of Yakutia, he found peace and wealth."
kck.4.a:0 "Our Klondike is not over."
kck.5.title:0 "육상교리 선택"
kck.5.desc:0 "Like an old tool, sometimes our practices in military efforts need to be replaced or improved upon. Several generals suggest that we look into mobility as a key factor in our Army, to counter the severe desolation of our territory. A few others claim that we should focus instead on artillery static positions and avoid moving intensely during battle, resulting in a better planned out attack. A few other officers agree, but a disagreement they have is with the focus on Artillery, instead preferring trenches and infantry."
kck.5.a:0 "Speed will drive Yakutia to the future!"
kck.5.b:0 "Cannons will wipe away our enemies!"
kck.5.c:0 "주의가 핵심이지!"
kck.6.title:0 "공중교리 선택"
kck.6.desc:0 "Our small airforce must modernize. This is very clear to us. Whilst many of our planes are old, there a great few pilots with immense ambition that have come to talk with us regarding the future of Yakutian aviation. The first group suggests that we should focus on strategic bombing, as it might be increasingly difficult to protect our airspace and subsequently might be better to focus on destroying the enemy. The second group disagrees, and believes that CAS airplanes should protect our soldiers and territory with great force, and focus our industry in such. The last group believes that our airplanes should be at the highest of quality possible, and subsequently suggest that we should focus on smaller, better quantities of planes intended for anti-CAS operations."
kck.6.a:0 "Yakutia will rain down hell to her enemies."
kck.6.b:0 "We must protect our soldiers."
kck.6.c:0 "A rusty plane is a bad plane."
kck.7.title:0 "해양교리 선택"
kck.7.desc:0 "Our territory has always been more focused on naval matters than military matters, being the gateway to the East for the Russian Empire, however, things must progress forward and many admirals across our country have suggested new modernization proposals for the improvement of our naval skills. The largest group wishes to focus as many resources as possible into Naval matters, and subsequently create a large, unbeatable navy that will protect the Sea of Okhotsk from our enemies. A smaller group, but still prominent, suggests that we should focus entirely on closing trade barriers around the advantageous position we have, and subsequently protect allied trade. The smallest but most ambitious group suggests that we focus on ambitious warfare involving naval invasions, and subsequently look into defending our convoys with Submarines."
kck.7.a:0 "야쿠티야가 태평양을 지배하라라!"
kck.7.b:0 "We must protect our trade."
kck.7.c:0 "I like the ambitious ones."
kck.8.title:0 "브리태니어 책략"
kck.8.desc:0 "Thousands of British investors and adventurers have arrived to Yakutia as per an agreement with the Republic of Yakutia and the United Kingdom, resulting in the eventual creation of a strong British community in a place otherwise unexpected to have them. This has resulted in great pride among the British public, who have proudly stated that they are now friends of the Yakutian people."
kck.8.a:0 "새 이스트포트에서 보낼 휴가가 기대되는군!"
kck.9.title:0 "페트로그라드에서의 소식"
kck.9.desc:0 "As much as we try to focus on keeping loyal to Russia, it appears that pressure might be taken off our backs as the Russian heartland has begun fighting brutally over the attempted coup against Kolchak's clique, who are now fighting the putschists. As we go on, it might be best to stick to neutrality in the conflict, but regardless to many Russians it is very upsetting to see their Empire tear itself apart."
kck.9.a:0 "새들의 다툼 속에 깃털이 여기까지 왔구나."
kck.10.title:0 "비극, 그리고 희망"
kck.10.desc:0 "It's a great horror to hear that your homeland is lost. Tens of thousands of Japanese immigrants into Yakutia, as when it was part of the Japanese sphere, have seen the end of their Crysantheum dynasty and tradition with a few swift, bloody movements against their way of life. Yet, hope still remains, as many aristocrats and members of the Japanese Yamato family have arrived in Yakutia as exiled royals, and subsequently have been treated as such. With the realization that Japan is lost, the local pro-Japanese admnistration understood their purpose; to proclaim an Empire in Exile which will hope to one day come back once the world intervenes, and the Japanese Empire will aid them. However, this time, they will be in the frozen lands of Yakutia, which have now been proclaimed a direct part of the Japanese Empire. Already, thousands of refugees are fleeing to our nation, and hope for a day where they can fight for the freedom of Japan and it's holy throne to be restored to Tokyo once more. For now, it has been restored in Yakutia, the new home of Japan."
kck.10.a:0 "아마테라스께서 우릴 인도하신다."
kck.11.title:0 "붉은 수병들의 반란!"
kck.11.desc:0 "Something absurd and unexpected just happened; within the group of people who fled Revolutionary Japan and escaped Socialism, there were multiple sailors which are aligned to the Revolutionary movement in Japan! These sailors have mutinied and taken over several ships, bombarding our coastal positions and slowly invading the inner areas. It seems that it is all but lost, and yet a new hope arises as several look to their friends in Zheltorossiya for partnership."
kck.11.a:0 "Let us join our fellow man in a Red future!"
kck.13.title:0 "마가단 책략"
kck.13.desc:0 "After several months of development, the President, Pavel Ksenofontov, has unveiled a grand project he likes to call the \"Magadan Scheme\", involving the development of a planned city near Okhostk, which would function as a new and vibrant port for several commercial ships to arrive in. However, this is not the end of Ksenofontov's ambition; he has imagined the city as an utopic example of Yakutian excellence, and subsequently as a cosmopolitan, free, and wealthy city in the far expanses of the North Pacific. Many members of his cabinet are worried this might cost a large sum of cash, but Ksenofontov has enough allies in the Parliament to pass it through, especially in the more socially-minded progressive sectors of his cabinet. Magadan has decided to be named this way as to be a form of expressing the cultural identity of the Lamut-Evenk people, who have praised the idea."
kck.13.a:0 "이상향과 같은 미래."
kck.14.title:0 "이스트포트 야망"
kck.14.desc:0 "After many months of introspection and development of the Republic, Pavel Ksenofontov has decided to pass a bill within Parliament for the creation of a new Planned City based on the coast, in the sea of Okhostk, where many British investors have arrived after the Britannia Scheme. This plan, according to Ksenofontov, will result in a prosperous city in less than 3 years, where a strong cosmopolitan, but also heavily British culture, will be created within the city, resulting in a perfect mix of ethnicities for a progressive, liberal city based on prosperity and freedom. Unfortunately, many Yakuts and Evenks, along with several other groups have opposed the idea, but the increasing British influence in Yakutia means that Ksenofontov is able to pass his bill through Parliament, resulting in a narrow majority which has allowed building to begin. The city, named in an Anglo manner, is justified by Ksenofontov to have this name as a way to pay homage to the British allies of Yakutia."
kck.14.a:0 "이스트포트 만세!"
kck.15.title:0 "디즈닙스크 발상"
kck.15.desc:0 "With Russian immigration coming into Yakutia and slowly making the Far-Eastern General Governorate be more and more homogenous, one of the many issues is space. Despite our immense land size, most of it is extremely difficult to inhabit and create roads on. Therefore, the Governor-General has decided to pass an order for the construction of a planned city near Okhostk, called Dezhnevsk. This city is named this way in homage to the first expedition to the Far East, and to represent a beacon of Russian culture in the Pacific. The city is planned to be inhabited entirely by Russians, of course."
kck.15.a:0 "디즈니프의 유산을 지켜냈다."
kck.16.title:0 "쇼와이치 계획"
kck.16.desc:0 "As part of our Holy Plan across the Pacific, the idea of creating cities and small colonies as a way to further protect Japanese interests across the Pacific, but specifically in Yakutia, seems very enticing. Thusly, Saburo Aizawa has passed a plan presented by his more ambitious peers to create a new, Japanese city in the coast of Yakutia. This city will be inhabited by as few Russians as possible, and as many Japanese people as possible, therefore creating a beacon of Japanese culture in the North Pacific, where the coldest days shall be warmed by the Rising Sun!"
kck.16.a:0 "쇼와 폐하를 위한 경의라."
