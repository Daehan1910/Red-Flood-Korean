kck.1.title:0 "한 제독의 삶"
kck.1.desc:0 "It was another freezing day all across the rump Far-Eastern General Governorate, as new investors come in through the port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and arrive in Yakutsk to discuss business. People played in the streets, some sang, some sold things. Things appeared good, until it seemed something was wrong. Very wrong. The Yakut workers across Yakutsk began to stop working; it almost felt like a subconscious movement that spanned every Yakut and other opressed group within the Governorate. But it was not subconscious; they had been planning this revolt for months, and it seemed like the most likely to succeed. Regardless, if it did not, dying for the dream of a free Yakutia is better than living under Russia, in the eyes of many. As this strike occured, it appeared that thousands of Yakuts began marching towards Yakutsk, the capital of the Governorate, and proclaimed in Russian and Yakut \"No more!\", resulting in massive, brutal response by the local police. However, the Yakuts, with their fighting and hunting experience, began to force the Russian police away from them. As they continued to march on the capital of Yakutsk, more reinforcements arrived from the northern areas, as more Russian officers came to the aid of their policemen. This revolt wasn't like the others. Regardless, the Yakut National Congress began to speak in front of a podium a few streets across from the Capital Building, and proclaimed that Yakutia would become a free nation opposed to Russian imperialism. Ksenofontov, aware of what is going on, quickly gets to work in keeping the act of neutrality, whilst Russian officers continue to attack violently against the Yakuts. Eventually, one group manages to win out, when..."

kck.2.desc:0 "Delegates from all over the cold and unforgiving land of Yakutia have come together in a single building located in Aldan, as an attempt to not centralize power in any particular city. Regardless, Ksenofontov couldn't spend all his time thinking about city choice for Constitutional matters. What mattered now was to secure a democratic and free future for all Yakutians. With a delegation of 2,431 members, 1,062 of whom being from local non-Slavic groups such as the Tungids. However, the rest of the groups are mostly Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, etc. Who were either forcibly settled or settled for opportunity. There is also one Permanent Japanese, American, and British delegate in the Constitution, a move considered controversial. Regardless, the constitutional convention continued as usual, with Ksenofontov leading the efforts to secure democratic policies and ensuring a balance between the Tungus peoples and the Slavs, alongside encouraging American and British investors to strengthen Yakutia's economy as a resource powerhouse. After 14 long hours of discussion, the Republic of Yakutia's constitution had been created, a land made for all to come and live freely, a land of true liberty and idealism."

One day he was drinking sake and looking outside his home in Nagasaki, when he kept researching across Japan for ways to avoid military service, which in his eyes would ruin his already fragile emotional and mental state. So, he began to develop connections. Psychologists, military-experienced people, all kinds of people as he began to get the latest news in Japanese politics. Then, he heard of an excursion of 200 Japanese officers to Yakuti... Yakutia? What are they doing in Russia again? \n \"Last time this happened, it didn't go well for us\", he thought. Yet, it felt like opportunity. He kept an eye on it. After a couple of weeks, he'd heard that the Japanese officers had successfully declared the independence of the Yakut people. This meant that it was, as he knew, a client state of Japan. It still didn't feel like enough to be a possible evasion; his dread increased. Yet, he'd heard of gold and other resources' mining in the area. Knowing this would be a good chance to work for the Government, Kurihara began to look into migration possibilities as an investor. Then, he began hearing of more stories, so many stories of people finding immense amounts of gold in undeveloped areas; it felt like he, himself, had struck gold in many ways. He began to pack his things, stopped paying rent, and went to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, slowly driving by taxi towards Okhotsk, and so, he began his ultimate attempt at success in life. He was there early, there weren't many Japanese mining in the area, but enough to have caused news in the homeland. He began to work as an independent miner, officially a \"Assistance Development Team Member\", finding immense quantities of gold never touched by man before. And like that, in the golden rocks of Yakutia, he found peace and wealth."

A few others claim that we should focus instead on artillery static positions and avoid moving intensely during battle, resulting in a better planned out attack. A few other officers agree, but a disagreement they have is with the focus on Artillery, instead preferring trenches and infantry."

The largest group wishes to focus as many resources as possible into Naval matters, and subsequently create a large, unbeatable navy that will protect the Sea of Okhotsk from our enemies. A smaller group, but still prominent, suggests that we should focus entirely on closing trade barriers around the advantageous position we have, and subsequently protect allied trade. The smallest but most ambitious group suggests that we focus on ambitious warfare involving naval invasions, and subsequently look into defending our convoys with Submarines."

Tens of thousands of Japanese immigrants into Yakutia, as when it was part of the Japanese sphere, have seen the end of their Crysantheum dynasty and tradition with a few swift, bloody movements against their way of life. Yet, hope still remains, as many aristocrats and members of the Japanese Yamato family have arrived in Yakutia as exiled royals, and subsequently have been treated as such. With the realization that Japan is lost, the local pro-Japanese admnistration understood their purpose; to proclaim an Empire in Exile which will hope to one day come back once the world intervenes, and the Japanese Empire will aid them. However, this time, they will be in the frozen lands of Yakutia, which have now been proclaimed a direct part of the Japanese Empire. Already, thousands of refugees are fleeing to our nation, and hope for a day where they can fight for the freedom of Japan and it's holy throne to be restored to Tokyo once more. For now, it has been restored in Yakutia, the new home of Japan."

However, this is not the end of Ksenofontov's ambition; he has imagined the city as an utopic example of Yakutian excellence, and subsequently as a cosmopolitan, free, and wealthy city in the far expanses of the North Pacific. Many members of his cabinet are worried this might cost a large sum of cash, but Ksenofontov has enough allies in the Parliament to pass it through, especially in the more socially-minded progressive sectors of his cabinet. Magadan has decided to be named this way as to be a form of expressing the cultural identity of the Lamut-Evenk people, who have praised the idea."

Thusly, Saburo Aizawa has passed a plan presented by his more ambitious peers to create a new, Japanese city in the coast of Yakutia. This city will be inhabited by as few Russians as possible, and as many Japanese people as possible, therefore creating a beacon of Japanese culture in the North Pacific, where the coldest days shall be warmed by the Rising Sun!"
