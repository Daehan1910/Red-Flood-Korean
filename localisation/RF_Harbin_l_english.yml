#Recovery#
HAR_indoor_farm:0 "Indoor Farms"
HAR_indoor_farm_desc:0 "Without any free space in the city, we are forced to get creative to counter the food issue. In this time of desperation, luxuries will be sacrificed for necessities! While sports grounds such as football fields can be converted into farmlands, it is not enough. We can secure the abandoned buildings throughout the city and convert them into indoor farms. Remove any furniture and dump the floor with soil, loam, and woodchips. Install lamps if necessary. It may not be pretty but as long as we can grow potatoes or raise poultry, we can live another day!"

HAR_street_runway:0 "Streets Into Runways"
HAR_street_runway_desc:0 "The streets of Harbin are empty since the new election. Which is perfect.

HAR_fortified_city_desc:0 "The Manchus guard the borders beyond our cities, preventing our trucks from getting out of the city and help coming in. We need to prepare for the worst should they antagonise us further. Bunkers will be bult on every major entrance to the city. To compliment our lack of military industry, we shall train our men to build their own makeshift guns to construct their own weapons against our enemies."

HAR_every_possible_business:0 "Centralised Economic Plan"
HAR_every_possible_business_desc:0 "In this time of trouble, we should not let these private companies run around amok, trampling over our starving citizens.

They shall be able to traverse through the most forgotten alleyways down to the most hidden canal!"

HAR_manchurian_pearl_desc:0 "Harbin had seen glories and up until now, the depths of man's mistake. For the past year, we have meticulously break our backs to rebuild this city to its former glory and more. Our people were once starving masses, lying in the slumps on every streets. But now our factories roared with life, our motorcars speeding down the streets once more. It is time we pile our resources and effort one last time to bring this city to greater heights! Buy up every empty lot in this city and shove a tram track down even the most narrow street. We'll make use of every inch of land we have!"
HAR_harbin_metro:0 "We shall refurbish Harbin from the bottom-up!"

HAR_reorganised_military:0 "Reorganise Military Leadership"
HAR_reorganised_military_desc:0 "As the days go closer to our inevitable reunification of the former Zheltorossiyan territory, we must ensure our generals are prepared for the worst. They shall fight day and night over the most effective strategy against the Manchu. They shall develop a new theory to cover up our lacking manpower. But most importantly, they must abandon all past ties to the old government that left them to die in our streets. White army? Republican army? Kolchakists? Socialists? No. We are all the people of Harbin."

HAR_challenge_the_dragon:0 "Challenge The Dragon"
HAR_challenge_the_dragon_desc:0 "Here we are, at the borders of Harbin. Beyond this street lies the Manchu army, once our greatest obstruction, now a mild annoyance. And beyond further that are the plains once owned by former Zheltorossiya. Plains with farmlands for food, and if luckily, loyal Russians, Ukrainians, and various Europeans, suffering under Manchu rule. With a step forward, we shall rush into this land..."

##Collapse Events
##Manchu Leaves
HAR.11.t:0 "만주인들이 독립을 선포하다!"
HAR.11.A:0 "만주의 용은 다시금 포효하리라!"
HAR.11.B:0 "Eh, I still prefer the Russians, to be honest...."
HAR.11.desc:0 "With the absence of governance created by the faliure of Zheltorossiyan government to solve the famine, many ethnic groups of Manchuria were left ungoverned, with the greatest authority across the Manchurian countryside  being whatever Mayor rules the scattered city and villages. China is no stranger to power vacuums, knowing very well that a lack of authority is quickly solved by a person with both ambition and power.\n The person that solved this chaos in the countryside was none other than Pu Wei, member of the Aisin Gioro clan, who once ruled not all of Manchuria, but all of China. He had ambition, he had a claim to the land, and above all he had the leadership skills to back up his desires.\n Pu Wei went everywhere to city, always winning supporters and land with his speech:\n 'The Manchu People have been under foreign rule for far too long. The Russian Bears of the North, the Japanese Dragons in the East, and the Han Tigers in the South; all of them desire the riches of Manchuria! This weakness of the Russian oppressor is an opportunity to once again be free. My clan once ruled this land, and we were the masters of the world! Will you die at my side so that our children may live once again?'"

##Priamurye Leaves
HAR.12.t:0 "러시아 공화국의 최후항전!"
HAR.12.desc:0 "“허기. 혼돈. 참극.\n The lands of Russia are no strangers to these words, especially with the events that led to the Russian Civil War and it’s aftermath. Zheltorossiya’s whole purpose was to shield the Russians of these factors, and to uphold the free and democratic values that are so essential to the people, even after losing the civil war to the vile Kolchak in the east.\n Kerensky’s administration, who so hopefully desired to bring light and freedom towards Russia, has falied the people with this accursed famine! A pitful end for such a beautiful dream.\n That would be, if it was over. The dream of the Russian Republic lives! At Vladivostok, I, Spiridon Merkulov, will live on. At Vladivostok, the hope of Zheltorossiya will live on, as the Republic of Priamurye. Me and my brothers who survived shall bear the burden of the eternal fight for peace and democracy, and as God as my eternal witness, we shall win, or we shall die trying.” \n Thus spoke Merkulov on the balcony of the temporary Duma, for all of Vladivostok to hear. The city and it’s outskirts, unlike most of the former Zheltorossiyan territory, is largely inhabited by Russians, and the city is a rich port town. There is no better place to begin the new story of Russia."
HAR.12.A:0 "For the Republic! For the People of Russia!"
HAR.12.B:0 "Democracy is dead, the dream is lost.... " 

##Green Ukraine Leaves
HAR.13.t:0 "우크라이나인들이 새 울을 선포하다!"
HAR.13.A:0 "Formam potribno nadaty zhyttya!"
HAR.13.B:0 "I won’t stray from Harbin… not yet."
HAR.13.desc:0 "When our ancestors migrated to this place, encouraged by free land, the Russian Empire had designs in mind for them. However their lives amounted to more than the grain shipments bound West, on their farms and in their homes, in their abjection, in their prosperity, the Ukranain people found a truth and a romance. We, the breathing shifting mass, have selected Kazmir Malewicz as our manifestor. He will elevate us to Godhood, because we will act upon this world as we please, and our actions will be testament unto themselves. Just as God inseminates his creation with his will to create Goodness, we will inseminate this country with our will, with our being, as it is and not as others would have it. \n Ukrainian officers and enlisted men have long formed a clique in the Zheltorossiyan army, and with the Harbin government’s failures, Ukranian divisions disappear wholesale into the countryside. They have truly severed themselves from the rest of the country and appear to be reorganizing and preparing to operate in their own interests."

##Yakutia Leaves
HAR.14.t:0 "야쿠티야가 황러시아에서 이탈하다"
HAR.14.A:0 "They will march back North, to their only home in this world..."
HAR.14.desc:0 "News came home quickly of the horrendous sights and sounds that consume the capital of the nation Yakutians have been tentatively calling theirs. A march of sorrow proceeded back to Yakutian heartlands, taking themselves and their sanity far away from Harbin. As soon as they were safely away, all who could sing sang a dirge to their futures in Zheltoroosia. Some met the exodus of Yakutians from Zheltorossian lands with smugness and mockery that they had ever trusted the Harbin government, but most shared in their despair. For a time they had all been happy to slot themselves more firmly into the supply chain of the regional economy and reap the benefits of trading for finished goods with a more developed industrial center. \n Their happiness has turned to ash in their mouths, and while it may be easy to blame one faction or another in the ultimate failure of Zheltorossyia, it is only fitting to blame themselves for throwing their lot in with a corrupt government. Yakutian authorities have formally withdrawn from the Zheltorossian government, and those who negotiated its original entry are drafting their resignation letters."

#Harbin - Manchu Border War
#Victory Against Manchus
HAR.20.t:0 "만주인들에게 맞서 거둔 승리!"
HAR.20.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to drive off the Manchu defenses in the countryside! We have made contact with the once Zheltorossiyan peasants of the region, promising them a new life in the pearl that is the newly revived Harbin City. With the plains secured, we have enough land to feed off our families and soldiers."
HAR.20.a:0 "One Step Towards Reunification!"
#Loss Against Manchus
HAR.21.t:0 "평원에서의 실패"
HAR.21.desc:0 "Even with our combined efforts, materiel readiness, and training, we were no match against the Manchu forces on their natural turf. Our failure to occupy even a measly pastoral region of its farmlands have made our government the laughing stock of the former Zheltorossiyan cliques. Just as the city of Harbin shone again, fires raged in the streets once more as the public were unhappy that their soldiers, their relatives, fought for naught against a much inferior combatant."
HAR.21.a:0 "We Bit Off More Than We Could..."
