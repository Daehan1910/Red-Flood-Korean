CHI_shared_economy:0 "Civil War Economy"
CHI_shared_economy_desc:0 "China's economy is a mix-match of Beiyang-backed currency and developing industry, with mostly agricultural exports, combined with a parallel Guomindang currency, industry and mixed exports. The largely market driven economy is fragile, and prone to the whims of foreign demands from the concession cities. While foodstuffs are usually in abundance, hunger is common in battle-torn regions. Meanwhile growing urban industrial centres are modernising a formerly agrarian country into something new and powerful."
