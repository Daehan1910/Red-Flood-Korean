#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Though many have tried, none have been able to remove Kerensky from power. Although him and his party have promised freedom and democracy to Zheltorossiya, many have taken notice of his unwillingness to resign as president, and fear he may further consolidate his power. Regardless, Kerensky is intent on carrying out the Russian Revolution, no matter what it takes."
POLITICS_GASTEV_DESC:0 "Given his extensive background of revolutionary activity, trade union activism, and advocacy for scientific economic management, Alexei Gastev was the perfect candidate for the Soviets on paper. However, only Gastev knew then what his true plans were. To transform Russia, and soon the world, into his final work of art. A realm of humanity's next evolution, Homo Metallum, guided entirely by scientific management. Gastev sees the proposal of planned economies as too moderate, instead proposing a planned society. And seeing as his plans are already in motion, it seems little will stand into the way…"
POLITICS_ALISA_DESC:0 "로젠바움은 다른 급진 이념가들이 그랬던 것처럼 백군의 러시아 내전 승리 직후 황러시아로 도망쳐왔습니다. 하지만, 다른 대부분의 동포들과 다르게 그녀는 러시아의 자본주의 경제에 관해 아무 이의를 제기하지 않았습니다. 오히려, 콜차크의 권위주의 정권은 자유와 시장이 절대적 우위에 있다는 급진적 형태의 자유주의로 로젠바움을 밀어넣었습니다. 질문은 여전히 남아있습니다. 로젠바움이 러시아를 매입할 것인가, 아니면 새 러시아 공화국을 위해 싸울 것인가?"
POLITICS_MILYUKOV:0 "오랫동안 카데츠의 지도자로 재직한 밀류코프는 개혁주의적 자유주의자로, 근래에 러시아 정권에게 쫓겨 이제 막 황러시아에 당도했습니다. 권력에 미친 폭군들과의 협상이 얼마나 잘못된 것인지 이제 깨달은 그는, 러시아에서 민주반란의 불꽃을 다시 태우고자 1905년과 1917년의 혁명가들 사이의 화해를 유도하려 합니다."
POLITICS_SPIRIDONOVA_DESC:0 "In a stunning turn of fate, Maria Spiridonova has managed to take power, bringing Anarcho-syndicalism to Russia. Distrusting of both authoritarian socialist ideologies and social democracy, Spiridonova aims to create a new Russian society with a stateless federation of trade unions. She also aims to mix the Soviet Feminist ideas of Alexandra Kollontai with Anarchist philosophy."
POLITICS_BOLDYREV_DESC:0 "Vasily Boldyrev is a military commander in the Russian army who has managed to seize power in Zheltorossiya. Just like most Russian warlords, Boldyrev has little ambition, and merely swears fealty to whoever controls the seat of power in Russia. He does, however, plan on bringing Russian values and governance to the remote region."
POLITICS_TROTSKY_DESC:0 "A former Internationalist general and prospective heir to Vladimir Lenin, Trotsky has been forced to continue waging the Russian Civil War from Zheltorossiya. However, in his exile, Trotsky has managed to rally with former Mensheviks to form a new radical wing of the RSDRP. It was this clique that easily won over the Zheltorossiyan peasantry and proletariat with promises of radicalization of socialist reforms and protection from famines and anarchist chaos. However, few know of Trotsky's true ambition: to restore the Soviet Union and shape it in his own ideological image."
POLITICS_KAMENEV_DESC:0 "A former ally of Leon Trotsky, Kamenev has taken leadership of the party on a Council Communist platform. Kamenev seeks to emulate the German Revolution, with his long-term goal being to create a federal union of council republics in Russia and its imperial territories. While managing to secure wide support among the people and party, radicals of all stripes have denounced him and presumably begun plotting against him."
POLITICS_DAN_DESC:0 "Originally a founding member of the Mensheviks, Fyodor Dan abandoned revolutionary parties altogether after their failure to bring socialism to Russia. Now, Dan sees cooperation with the RSDRP as the only effective means of opposing the Kolchakocracy. With Kolchak's downfall, they hope to implement a form of agrarian socialism more suited to the Russian peasantry."
POLITICS_CHAPAYEV_DESC:0 "A radical Anarchist general in Kerensky's army, Chapayev saw an opportunity in the political turmoil surrounding the famines in Zheltorossiya. The people were suffering, and they cried out in anger at a government which had failed to deliver on its promises. The people demanded justice, and as Chapayev listened to their cries, he resolved to give it to them. But he realized something else, too. No one can truly be trusted with the people's freedom. No one, that is, except the people themselves. Chapayev's military experience has thus far equipped him to protect his chaotic realm, but only time can tell how long the fragile peace will last."
POLITICS_AVKSENTIEV_DESC:0 "Nikolai Avksentiev has come out on top of the triumvirate along with the PSR faction with a plan of socialization and agrarian socialism. Although sharing the same party, Avksentiev has decided to distance himself from Boris Savinkov in Belarus, and aims to rebrand the party."

After some minutes a shot rang out over a silent Harbin and the voice of Alexei Gastev came over the airwaves. Far from the reassuring voice of a strong leader, Gastev introduced himself almost timidly. He proclaimed the IPK's collective leadership of the Republic, he laid out an ultimatum to the opposition to abandon their efforts at seizing power from the appointed President. He then named a long list of \"traitors\", his voice was calm and rythmic. He intonated as though he were reading a story book. Once the list was completed, he spoke of the great collective designs of the Proletkult, the great plans for the Republic and the role every single person had to play in the great future of the revolution. Here his calm voice seemed almost passionless, political rhetoric with quiet conviction and no pompous rousing.

His commitment to the people’s freedom and the safety of Russia is something that is admirable and praiseworthy, and the Directorate’s guiding hand shall forever keep us safe. The Revolutionary Army is committed to his ideals, and all of Russia shall experience his true glory. Hail Kerensky! Hail the republic!A speech he gave earlier today in front of the Directorate has solidified the people’s faith in him. “The leader in a republic,'' he said, “must not merely be a parliamentary figure, but the unifier of all its citizens. Russia is composed of many kinds of people, and both the Tsar, the Bolsheviks and the Kolchak government only drove a wedge in between them. But we are all Russians, stretching from Petrograd to Vladivostok, and they can be unified by a common national identity and a leader whom they respect and adore. The people have willed me into office, and thus I am their sword and shield! They adore their elected officials like they would God himself, and this is not sacrosanct, but holy!”\nHis statements in today’s meeting has been criticized by some as being authoritarian and resembling more the dictatorship in France than a true republican government. But He, that representation of the republic’s ideals, shall strike down these fools and traitors, and the Russian nation shall rise once more. "

ZHR.25.desc:0 "The formation of ROSTA has been widely approved by the Directorate, as it is vital to ensure that Kerensky’s government is well-respected and trusted by the people of the republic. Republican values must be defended through the pen as well as the sword, and this includes posters, music, and of course, radio. Testing the new program, Kerenky gave a speech today on the evils of Bolshevism and the necessity to crush it.\n“Radicals, anarchists, Marxists; they are all the same. They seek to destroy what we have built here in favour of a regimented dictatorship. They hate our republic, and wish to subjugate you to the worst kinds of slavery and terror. I shall not allow it; every Bolshevik terrorist and his ilk will be put to the sword or the spade! They shall either work for you or die for you! Your liberty is dependent upon their subjugation or their destruction. Make no mistake citizens, for while this may seem cruel, it is mercy. For they would do far, far worse if they had even a single finger upon a pistol. We know how this song and dance ends; you have all read about what has happened in Germany after their revolution, or the fate of the generals in Hungary, or the current sufferings of the Brazillian people. This shall not happen here.”\n“Me and the Directorate shall represent and defend you at every cost. The Russian fatherland must be governed not with mere talk, but with a firm hand and a steadfast march. Kolchak, Trotsky, Drozdovsky; all shall be thrown out of this country. The new Republican Russia shall rise forth and liberate the world from tyranny! We are the standard bearers of an order never before seen! The chains shall be thrown off, and the people shall stand victorious!”"

ZHR.26.desc:0 "Leading this country is hard work. Everyday, there are deals that have to be made, enemies of the state to be killed, bills to pass, and so many other things. As he let his head lay on the pillow of his bed, Kerensky felt exhausted from the constant work. Sleep was the only time he could sit down and relax. Truly, he was a martyr, suffering on the behalf of the Russian people; at least, that’s what he thought.\nBut as he drifted off into slumber, he saw the most wonderful thing. He saw a map of the current world, but it started to move and change. Kingdoms and empires became republics, the accelerationist governments fell into disarray, and the Bolshevik menace in Berlin toppled. It was a world of fraternal republics, and it was beautiful. Kerensky realized his purpose in that moment; it wasn’t just to save Russia, but to bring about the End of History. His republic was the final form that all other powers would emulate; the radical changes and uprisings of years past would be replaced with slow and steady reform and change. These republics, lead by a Directorate and a powerful leader, could save the world.\nKerensky had a greater purpose than ever before. His armies and strength would plunge into darkness and come out victorious, cutting of the heads of Bolshevism and monarchism. Fraternal republics would stand free and sovereign once more! When he woke from his slumber, he knew what he was. As Nietzsche said"

According to Kerensky, the new army’s job is to spread the ideals of democracy and republican government to Russia and the entire world. To serve Russia, the soldier must be loyal to Kerensky, the Directorate and the people, and must be selfless in their service to the nation. They must keep themselves detached from all political parties, and should only have the nation in mind when they charge into battle, and not just some foreign ideology exported from France or Berlin.\nKerensky evoked the role of the Levée en masse of the French Revolution when speaking about the nature of the new army. “Thousand were conscripted to serve, and in spite of everything, they won. The monarchist dogs were repelled and France was saved. We are in the same spot, and thus, require the same dedication and willingness to serve. Otherwise, we shall perish!”"
