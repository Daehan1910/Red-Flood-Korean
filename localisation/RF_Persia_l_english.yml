PER_SETTING_SUN_DESC:0 "The Shahdom of Persia has suffered humiliation and the bitter curse of its oil wealth. during the Russian Civil War the roaming armies and nationalist factions rolled over the western part of the country, forming rebel states and tearing at the Shah's power. Russian and British interests and the Shah's luxurious tastes have rendered the state a mere slave to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This misfortune and shame has set the stage for a radical shake-up in Persia, one that the Shahdom would do well to survive."

per.101.desc:0 "The latest incident happened in Ilam. A city well known for its oil production, it also happens to be full of Kurds  - flashpoint for violence and ethnic strife if ever there was one. While the sequence of events remains unclear, we have gotten a rough understanding of what’s going on. Apparently, some onion vendor in the city was plying his wares when he got into a fight with an Englishman over the prices. While both blamed each other, the incident was used to spark a major protest that grew into a riot. Unfortunately, some socialist elements in the mob directed them to attack a prison and to free the onion salesman, claiming him to “A hero opposing the tyranny of Britain and the Shah”. This shouldn’t be a major cause for concern if not for the fact that the socialists not only blame the British for the arrest of the innocent onion salesman but have risen to attack their offices and anyone who so much as speaks English, pelting them with rocks and symbolically onions.\nBelieving him to be the ringleader, we secretly had the idiot onion salesman sneaked back to Tehran for interrogation, and we’re going to discover the full extent of his plans. Numerous parts of the country are rioting, much of it stirred up by the socialists. The British ambassador also made a personal visit to the Shah, informing him that his nephew had been “greatly insulted” by some “vegetable merchant” and demanding justice. Still, we believe that we can salvage this by interrogating who people on the streets cheer as the “Onion Revolutionary” and working out the full extent of his little plot to overthrow the Shah. Worse still, communications have slowed down and a number of cities administrations are crippled by the spontaneous solidarity demonstrations."

per.2.desc:0 "The past few decades have not been kind to the Persian nation. Following the many humiliations and cruel occupations by foreign tyrants such as the rugged Russian bear or that accursed lion of Albion, the once great empire of the Near East has fallen from a regional hegemon and the protector of the Shia faith to just another forgettable and impoverished rump state, crushed under the heel of foreign domination.\nIt was taken for granted that the fall of these giants following the Great War would bring prosperity to Persia. But despite the collapse of the British raj and the Russian Civil War, we fell only further. Revolutionaries, opportunists, secessionists and their marauding bands of thugs and savages, wandered across our lands and carved it up into many different states and nations. British troops, in response to the vacuum left by the collapsing Russian Empire only tightened their grip on Persia, leaving us unable to respond to the injustices in the West.\nThis only intensified in the following years as the loss of the Raj fueled British demand for Iranian oil, leading to the Shah becoming little more than a puppet with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) effectively controlling the country. The lack of checks and balances on the influence and strength of the APOC has had the deeply concerning side effect of pushing workers, peasants and nationalists into the hands of Socialist movements in reaction to Capitalist agitation and exploitation of Persian territories. Support for the councilist menace has achieved its strongest forms in ethnically Non-Persian pieces of land that miraculously did not break away in the 20’s. A state of affairs that has made the situation far more dire as it risks not only unacceptable political change, but also risks the territorial integrity of the already beaten and mutilated body of Persia.\nIt seems undeniable to many that in the coming years, the Jewel of the Orient will either fall to the red flood or use it’s conquerors to crush it, even if it may come at the cost of total integration. Nothing however, is ever for certain. And only time will tell what God has in store for us."

It’s deep connections to the British Empire mean that action against them could throw us into conflict with the Anglo menace. A fate that none are eager to see come about. The reasons APOC cites for these demands are based mainly on the rising threat of war in Europe and how Britain needs easier access to Persian oil fields in order to fuel their vast navy and rapidly expanding air force.\nBritain and the APOC have also been quick to remind us about our debts to the United Kingdom from various loans that we have taken throughout the years, and that Britain would not hesitate to force out payment from us should the need arise, no matter how harsh the actions may be.\nThese debt obligations give us little choice in the matter. It would be foolish to risk embargoes, or worse, war with the Anglo menace. Even if it shall disgrace the Persian nation."

This demand was not unexpected, as the ambitions of the young ruler Mohammad Reza are in stark contrast to his middling father’s. The shots of the Iranian civil war are still echoing throughout the Middle East, but the shah seems ready to lead his nation into another war, to regain its former glory. We simply cannot let another Iranian hegemony happen in the region, not to mention letting our rightful lands out of our hands, but the shah seems fanatical about his claims, and who knows how could an Iranian-Afghan conflict end for our country.\n\nWe have 12 hours to respond to this ultimatum: we either hand over the territories or we show Tehran that we’re not afraid to face them."

He finished said speech with an ancient Farsi proverb:\n“Every nation is the architect of its own fortune.”\nThis diplomatic success made Mohammed Reza more popular than ever, as there were more celebrations throughout the whole country and in the capital. But for the empire, this is only the beginning. Many of our old territories are still under foreign control.

As the shah brought these news to light, riots broke out in the capital. An angry mob stormed into the Afghani Embassy of Tehran, damaging the building and lynching two delegates.

The delegates from the APOC have "offered" these re-negotiated terms in lieu of a number of debt-service payments, which cannot be covered with our current revenues. While it is also true that the government will receive a sizable share of the profits, the Shah's court was outraged that the imperial government was not able to secure a large share of the revenue from the new concessions.\nMore concerning are the expanded concessions; vocal arguments have filled the Imperial Palace for hours now, with demonstrators taking to the street to oppose this apparent abnegation of Persian sovereignty. \nAt the end of the day, the Shah said that, with a heavy heart and with much regret, he has accepted the Company's proposal. The Shah cited the fact that refusal could result in a government default, possibly provoking a dramatic response from London, a course of events which - he emphasized - the Persian nation cannot afford. \nThe public has been rather less understanding of the government's situation, violently expressing discontent in a number of cities; the APOC is rumored to be expanding their deployment of mercenary troops in response."

Without their monopoly or even presence in one of the most oil-rich regions of the world their investors have pulled out and the company has gone under, officially ending decades of oppression and exploitation of Persian land and people.\nThe Councilists themselves were hardly a unified force, being composed of a large coalition party made up of the Hezb-e Jangal, the Iran Party and the People’s Mujahideen of Iran. But despite the many splits between the Councilist forces have been largely ignored as the streets of all but the most conservative villages of Persia have been flooded with song, celebrations and much cheer at the downfall of the British puppetry of their nation and that symbol of three thousand years of autocracy known as the Shah. Workers, farmers, minorities, the poets and the artisans have in unison declared the day of national liberation from foreign imperialism, from autocracy and from bourgeois oppression!\nDespite the largely secularist connotations of Socialism, the Persian people have not only praised Socialism for the liberation but also (especially those following the People’s Mujahideen of Iran) have declared that Socialism is indeed the will of God and the true way of Islam. While this may seem inoffensive, it is important to note that this shows that the many factions of Councilist Persia will have to make sure of the path they take and the implications it will have, not just with the expectations of other factions but also the will of the people.\nStill, the question of the exact path that Persia will go down now that it has become the latest stronghold of Socialism in the world is not one on the forefront of many people’s minds.

The people that fought for the Socialist cause were unified in a desire for routing foreign domination over Persia, but this does not mean there was any form of general agreement on a specific ideology within Socialism that the Persian Revolution ought to follow. Now that the celebrations and jolities of liberation from foreign domination have begun to  subside, it is time that we address the issue of leadership.\n\nFor the first time in the nation’s history, Persia had become a true democracy. Not one fitted with the liberal illusions of democracy which seek to only keep the Capitalist in power while giving the illusion of popular will. No, Persia had become a true democracy, one where the old feudal institutions hold no sway over the worker! With such massive upheaval, we could only have hoped to follow the will of the people by holding free, nationwide elections! Naturally, reactionary parties were forbidden from running and those with connections to Pro-Shah forces were not allowed to vote either. But other than those necessary restrictions on anti-worker groups there were no restrictions on who could vote.\nThe elections had been filled with a myriad of different parties and independents. But the election was dominated by two main factions. The Jangal Party, led by Mirza Kochak Khan and the coalition calling itself the Tudeh Party led by Reza Radmanesh. The Jangal Party was originally a sepratist organisation, waging a low-level insurgency in the Northern parts of Persia, now they espouse a morenationalist rhetoric (albeit after severe denunciations of cultural chauvinism), being strong supporters of the idea that one can have pride within their nation and still yearn for the liberation of the people. The Jangal party’s aims are for the immediate development of the productive forces via industrialisation of Iran, so it may rise up from being a feudal desert, into the Tiger of the Orient and (more controversially) the decentralisation of the nation into a socialist federation of all Persian speaking people’s. This platform is further made popular among more conservative minded voters by the party refusing to take a secularist stance. Rather than hold a specific religious doctrine, the Jangal insist that Islam can and will work alongside socialism. The Tudeh meanwhile is a far newer organisation, being formed from various Socialist and Marxist councils, many of whom were the ones that fired the first shots of the Revolution and war of independence against the Anglo dogs. The Tudeh wish to re-take all the lands that broke away from Persia in the last few years while also seeking to create a new type of Socialism, a form of “Syndicalist-Agrarianism”. Unique to the material conditions of Iran. Controversially, the Tudeh also wishes to standardise the Persian language as lingua franca across minority populated regions in order to ensure that such acts of subversion cannot happen again.\n\nAnd so, after weeks of campaigning from both sides, the nation holds its breath as representatives of the worker councils walk into the First Session of the Workers Council."

Many Russians took up arms to support themselves after leaving their country for one reason or another, and these men have proven their skills on the battlefields of China and beyond.
