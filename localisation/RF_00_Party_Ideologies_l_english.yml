anarchism_desc:0 "아나키스트 집산체"
social_anarchism:0 "사회 아나키즘"
social_anarchism_desc:0 "사회 아나키즘은 is an umbrella term for doctrines of revolutionary anarchism that advocate direct democracy, abolition of private property (though some strains retain respect for personal property) and restructuring of society along non-hierarchical lines. Deriving from teachings of Kropotkin, Bakunin, and to a certain degree Proudhon, social anarchist thought puts an emphasis on mutual aid as interrelated with individual freedom and endorses common or cooperative ownership of the means of production. The most notable currents of social anarchism are: anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism and collectivist anarchism."
individualist_anarchism:0 "개인주의적 아나키즘"
individualist_anarchism_desc:0 "개인주의적 아나키즘은 is a broad set of anarchist views which break with the more mainstream and mass oriented strains of anarchism. While differing widely in worldview all place the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, tradition, and other societal systems. These currents range from Thoreau's isolation in the woods, to the philosophies of natural right espoused by Godwin and Spooner, to illegalism and Stirner's total egoism. Although anarcho-individualism disagrees with social branches of anarchism, they often work together to achieve common goals, including abolition of hierarchy and all exploitative property."
stateless_anarchy:0 "무법"
stateless_anarchy_desc:0 "Lawlessness is not an ideology, but rather a situation of a complete collapse of all authority in a region as a result of either mismanagement or the previously existing government being destroyed. This term can also describe geographical areas which have never been organized into a state."

vanguard_socialism:0 "전위사회주의자"
vanguard_socialism_noun:0 "전위사회주의"
vanguard_socialism_desc:0 "사회주의 정권"
leninism:0 "레닌주의"
leninism_desc:0 "레닌주의는 is the name applied to the 사회주의 학파 that developed around exiled Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. A product of the situation observed in Russia and other countries where the working class was not as established and politically active as that of Germany, this tendency advocates for a revolutionary vanguard party to organize and educate the workers toward their own emancipation. Furthermore, it calls for a "dictatorship of the proletariat" as a tool to revolutionize the country along the path to socialism and communism. Also informed by the ideologue's Russian experience is a support for national self-determination in order to settle issues of ethnocentrism and oppression that are considered distractions from class struggle."
national_vanguardism:0 "민족전위주의"
national_vanguardism_desc:0 "민족전위주의는 민족주의적이고 사회주의적인 사상 및 정책의 혼합을 설명할 때 쓰이는 용어입니다. Typically advocating a state-run economy and a one-party state led by a revolutionary vanguard, this tendency advocates a turn to nationalism in order to secure and protect the revolution. Through upholding that identity, militarism, and national glory, the national vanguardist project is to strengthen the appeal of socialism within the nation and prepare it for revolutionary struggle with its enemies, both within and without."
state_socialism:0 "국가사회주의"
state_socialism_desc:0 "국가사회주의는 is a political system in which the country is placed under the tutelage of a political vanguard, which operates a socialist economy in a top-down manner. Sometimes occurring as a transitional stage following the revolution, this term alludes to existing Marxist theories of socialism, but is not necessarily a part of them, serving as a catch-all for states not adequately described by other vanguard socialist ideologies."

popular_socialism:0 "인민사회주의자"
popular_socialism_noun:0 "인민사회주의"
popular_socialism_desc:0 "사회주의 체제"
spartakism:0 "스파르타쿠스주의"
spartakism_desc:0 "그 선구자들 중 한 명의 이름 따 때때로 룩셈부르크주의로도 불리는 스파르타쿠스주의는 대전쟁 이후 세계 극좌의 주류를 차지한 사회주의 학파를 가리키는 용어입니다. The example forged by the German Revolution includes a number of precepts: first, fervent internationalism; second, rejection of the "vanguard party" concept in favor of multiparty democracy between factions that support the revolution; and third, partly owing to the circumstances in Germany at the end of the Great War, anti-militarism and anti-imperialism. Originally springing from a modern industrial capitalist society, it has the strongest presence in states with a large and developed urban proletariat."
syndicalism:0 "생디칼리슴"
syndicalism_desc:0 "생다칼리슴은 is a strain of socialist thought that views revolutionary industrial unionism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of the economy and, with that control, influence broader society. Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self-activity and as an alternative co-operative economic system with production centered on meeting human needs. Usually syndicalist movements advocate some form of central government to coordinate production, as well as in the use of a revolutionary political party in addition to union action to achieve its goals."
folk_socialism:0 "민중사회주의"
folk_socialism_desc:0 "민중사회주의는 is a strain of socialism aspiring to the goals and methods of spartakism or syndicalism while being understanding of the needs and circumstances of an un- or under-developed polity. Without a developed urban proletariat, it typically makes greater appeals to rural and peasant populations, recognizing their values and interests while still attempting to lift them from their material conditions through the establishment of socialism. As a result, folk socialism typically has a greater presence in current and recently-liberated colonial territories, as well as among other "pre-capitalist" states."

revisionist_socialism:0 "수정사회주의자"
revisionist_socialism_noun:0 "수정사회주의"
revisionist_socialism_desc:0 "사회주의 정권"
democratic_socialism:0 "민주사회주의"
democratic_socialism_desc:0 "민주사회주의는 생산수단의 사회소유권과 더불어 정치민주정을 요구하는 정치이념으로, 사회주의적 경제체제 아래서의 기업의 민주적 경영을 흔히 강조합니다. 민주사회주의자들은 자본주의가 자유, 평등, 연대라는 민주적 가치들과 본질적으로 양립할 수 없다고 보며, 자본주의에 내재된 문제들은 개인소유권을 사회소유권의 일종으로 전환했을 때에만 해결될 수 있을 것이라 여깁니다."
religious_socialism:0 "종교사회주의"
religious_socialism_desc:0 "종교사회주의은 is an umbrella term for schools of socialism that have found common cause between the materialist ideology and certain aspects of a faith. Movements and figures in the past are sometimes claimed as prototypical religious socialists, but currently, principles such as solidarity and social justice, as well as anti-imperialism or anti-capitalism, have led to the explicit fusion of the two philosophies. Social policy under religious socialism varies depending on the faith and how literal the movement's adherence to it is."
agrarian_socialism:0 "농업사회주의"
agrarian_socialism_desc:0 "Agrarian socialism refers to movements fusing socialism and the agriculturalist way of life. Rather than mainly being concerned with control over the means of industrial production, it emphasizes the land, often stressing collective ownership and local autonomy, or that socialism can be achieved without progressing through a capitalist phase of development. As a result, Agrarian Socialism has its strongest appeal in areas that are predominantly rural and pre-industrial."

progressivism:0 "진보주의자"
progressivism_noun:0 "진보주의"
progressivism_desc:0 "민주 정권"
progressive_democracy:0 "진보민주정"
progressive_democracy_desc:0 "Progressive democracy is a political doctrine deriving from the progressive movement of the United States which advocates extensive social and economic reforms. Its aim is to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy by progressive taxation, regulations imposed on large corporations and various means of providing aid to the disadvantaged. Progressives are committed to parliamentary democracy and advocate for distribution of assets as widely as possible in order to reach a political system where every man and woman has equality of opportunity."
left_populism:0 "좌익 대중주의"
left_populism_desc:0 "Left-wing populism refers to political movements advocating action for the benefit of the common people, understood generally as the lower classes of the country rather than financial, social, or political elites. Broadly, it supports regulation of the economy for the general interest, coupled with state investment and welfare provisions. Left-wing populism in a country may also constitute a movement or party united behind a specific public figure and their policies."
social_nationalism:0 "사회민족주의"
social_nationalism_desc:0 "Social nationalism, also known as left-wing nationalism, is an ideology which is based upon the principles of social equality and popular sovereignty while retaining the belief in the necessity of upholding some cultural or national identity. Similarly to other progressive movements, it endorses state regulation of the economy combined with various forms of social aid. Social nationalism has its roots in Jacobinism of the French Revolution and became popularised among many national independence movements retaliating against foreign imperialism. Although it stands in contrast to right-wing nationalism and typically rejects ethnic nationalism, some more radical interpretations of this ideology aren't unheard of."

liberalism:0 "자유주의자"

liberalism_desc:0 "민주정권"
classical_liberalism:0 "고전 자유주의"
classical_liberalism_desc:0 "고전 자유주의 is the original form of liberalism established by the American and French Revolutions. Classical liberalism advocates for equality of political rights and legal status for all while seeking to restrict political participation to the wealthier classes to some extent. It tends to support smaller states with enumerated powers, separation of church and state, and checks and balances between separate branches of government, along with laissez-faire economics, private property, and class paternalism. Classical liberal movements are usually republican, though they may also support strictly constitutional monarchies."
social_liberalism:0 "사회자유주의"
social_liberalism_desc:0 "사회자유주의는 개인의 자유에는 일정 수준의 사회정의를 필요로 한다 여기는 정치이념입니다. 고전자유주의와 같이, 사회자유주의 또한 시장경제와 민간 및 정치적 권리 및 자유를 옹호하지만, 핀곤, 의료, 교육과 같은 경제 및 사회사안에 있어서 정부의 정통적 역할을 논할 때엔 의견을 달리합니다. 사회자유주의에서는 공동체의 선이 개인의 자유와 조화를 이룰 수 있다고 봅니다."
libertarian_capitalism:0 "자유의지주의적 자본주의"
libertarian_capitalism_desc:0 "자유의지주의적 자본주의 is a radical form of liberalism advocating for total maximisation of personal freedom and reducing the role of the State to the possible minimum, which is expected to serve exclusively as a watchman protecting individual rights and largely rejecting the importance of groups such as class or ethnicity. Embracing a laissez-faire approach to economy, libertarian capitalists argue that only under a free market the individual can fully exercise their freedom, categorically condemning any form of collectivism or interventionism as tyranny. With its roots going as far back as Classical Liberalism of the Enlightenment the main currents of Libertarian Capitalism are the European political ideas connected to the Austrian School of Economics."

national_conservatism:0 "민족보수주의"
national_conservatism_desc:0 "민족보수주의 is used to describe nationalist groups that advocate for their national interest first and foremost, with preserving a perceived social status quo or ideals being their chief other concern. National conservatives can espouse support for democracy or parliamentarianism, but often view the national interest as something that supersedes the rights of its citizens."
liberal_conservatism:0 "자유보수주의"
liberal_conservatism:0 "자유보수주의 is a term describing a fusion of more classically liberal ideals with a conservative stance, valuing individuality as well as the society and nation. While in general they tend to be laissez-faire when it comes to capitalism, they are still highly skeptical of social change, with reforms only being considered if they seem truly necessary. Liberal conservatism also highly values the rule of law, with constitutions, institutions, and statutes being seen as irrevocable, eschewing violent and extreme means of gaining power or changing in favor of keeping the state stable."

anocracy:0 "준민주정"
anocracy_desc:0 "준민주정은 민주적 특징들과 권위주의적 특징들을 모두 포함하는 국가를 가리킵니다. 이들 국가들의 대부분은 다당제를 채택하고 있지만, 야당의 존속과 선거 개최를 국가가 허용하는 한도 안에서 이루어지기에 집권당은 그리 크게 위협을 받지 않습니다. 이 위치는 때때로, 선거운동에서 집권당이 구조상 주요 이점을 획득하는 등의 명백한 부정선거를 통해 유지됩니다. 준민주정은 또한 집권 정예층 가운데서만 경쟁할 후보를 고르도록 합니다."

Often used to describe governments which rely on, or are heavily supported financially by, a small number of large private interests; such that the government cannot be said to be truly separate from those companies themselves. Corporatocracies run their governments for the benefit of the corporations in control of them, often to the detriment of their citizens or an under-class of citizens."

absolute_monarchism:0 "절대군주주의"
absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "Absolute monarchism is a form of monarchy in which one ruler has supreme authority and where that authority is not restricted by any written laws, legislature, or customs. While the Monarch may depend on a circle of close advisors or ministers, his prerogatives remain above natural law and derive legitimacy from an equation of his position to the state itself."
military_dictatorship:0 "군사독재"
military_dictatorship_desc:0 "Military dictatorship is an autocratic form of government in which the state apparatus is wholly under the control of a high-ranking military officer. It is often claimed to be a temporary measure in order to prevent a takeover by other, radical movements. Under its aegis, state security forces are empowered against dissent, the government may exert a larger influence over the economy, and the state may pursue an "army-first" policy when allocating funding. Sometimes, a cult of personality is employed to give the regime further legitimacy.."

religious_fundamentalism:0 "종교근본주의"
religious_fundamentalism_desc:0 "Religious fundamentalism is a political stance that defends the authority of the law, the principles, and the institutions of particular religious beliefs. Religious Fundamentalists advocate their position based upon their belief that their religion, or sometimes - the deity or deities themselves through an earthly intermediary - must hold total control of politics in society. This system would then pursue radical reforms to accommodate for this theocratic and traditionalist interpretation of dogma. Among the groups that adhere to this position are certain schools of Islam and Buddhism, Hindu sects, and ultra-reactionary interpretations of Christianity, although many other circles may fall under this specific label."
esoteric_reactionism:0 "반동밀교주의"
esoteric_reactionism_desc:0 "lamoring for times long gone, reactionary esotericists form the most harsh opposition to social change and progress. Believing that the mythos has been lost in exchange for the logos in the process of human history, they advocate for restoration of an ancient time, usually referring to a once-great civilization, accompanying spiritual values, traditional morality and ancient social strata. Reactionary esotericists are often present in secret clubs or small, aristocratic societies, usually spouting mysticism and other forms of connecting to the metaphysical."

accelerationism_desc:0 "촉진주의 정권"
national_rejuvenatism:0 "민족재건주의"
national_rejuvenatism_desc:0 "National rejuvenation is a phrase attributed to a specific kind of revolutionary and nationalist movements which aim to strengthen the nation and enhance its cultural life by forging a new national identity. This reinvigoration is achieved through uniting closely related cultural groups, revising tradition and formulating a new mythos. National Rejuvenation is a radically modernist and technophilic ideology which stands in opposition to both capitalism and communism alike, supports some degree of state-guided economy and is usually highly authoritarian, believing that a nation can only be brought into a brighter future with the strong hand of the state. However, there exist exceptions to that rule which advocate complete rejection of state apparatus."
futurism:0 "미래주의"
futurism_desc:0 "Futurism is an avant-garde artistic and socio-political movement which originated in Italy at the dawn of the Great War and has since inspired various political movements all around the world. Although its concept of a desired economic and political structure varies from country to country, futurism is commonly characterised by glorification of modernity, worship of technological innovations, anti-capitalism and rejection of all things considered traditional or bourgeois. The most significant branches of Futurist thought are concentrated in Europe: a fervently nationalist ideology promoting youth and militant heroism in the west, and a movement closely tied to international communism in the east."
technocratism:0 "기술관료정"
technocratism_desc:0 "Technocracy presents a project of a social order in which governance is conducted through scientific methods instead of a popular, spiritual or dictatorial mandate. Though the implementation of these methods varies among different governments, the constants are an establishment of an extensive bureaucracy, limitations placed on the democratic process, and elements of economic planning instituted to various degrees. The social and economic forces compromising a society are to be understood and sufficiently mastered, then directed towards some kind of common good through the practice of social engineering. To achieve this goal, technocrats support advancements in technology, seeing methods used in its production as analogous to ones that can be useful in organizing a state."
