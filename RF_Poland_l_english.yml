POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC = "대전쟁 직후 이어진 독일과 러시아의 붕괴에 따라, 폴란드는 몇 세기에 걸친 외세의 지배라는 잿더미 속에서 다시 태어났습니다. 피우수트스키 장군이 이끄는 폴란드는 이른바 "인테르마리움"이라는 동유럽 방위협약을 형성함으로써 독일, 러시아, 체코슬로바키아에 이르는 주변의 위협을 물리치고 이겨냈습니다. 하지만 이것도 15년 전이니, 피우수트스키는 이제 늙었습니다. 암 투병으로 병상에 누운 그가 얼마나 버틸 진 알 수 없습니다만, 대원수가 자신의 최후의 전투에서 패배하는 것도 시간 문제에 불과합니다."

#EVENTS#
poland.1.t:0 "피우수트스키의 부재"
poland.1.desc:0 "The public worries as our great marshal and head of the state Józef Piłsudski hasn't left his home for two weeks. His poor health has been on decline for few years now but it has never left him strapped down to bed before. Many claim that we have to prepare for the worst."
poland.1.a:0 "The nation prays for him"
poland.2.t:0 "원수의 죽음"
poland.2.desc:0 "What everyone feared the most has finally happened. At an age of 69, Józef Piłsudski, our dear Marshal of Poland has died after a long battle with liver cancer. He left behind grieving family and a nation on a crossroads. While nominally democratic, Poland was practically ruled by him with his influence being an open secret. Now that he is gone, no one is truly sure what can happen."
poland.2.a:0 "Let us remember his successes and mourn his passing."
poland.4.t:0 "The Gathering of Emergency Government"
poland.4.desc:0 "The entire sanation bloc is troubled by questions, \"What to do now? Who should take the reign?\" Should it be the current government?, now freed from dictatorial power? Will it be able to democratize the nation and bring its citizens freedom and prosperity? Will it be the army? A Military takeover might be necessery to prevent chaos from shaking both Poland and the entire Intermarium. Or may there be... a third option? A Fresh and dynamic movement, developed over the years in the fringes of Piłsudski's camps. While seen as crackpots by their opponents, the organisation seemed to be fiercely loyal to marshal and thus deemed harmless and not worthy of persectution. It meanwhile grew using ideas of socialism, nationalism and anti-imperialism to gain supporters from seemingly opposing camps. Lead by controversial artist Stanisław Szukalski and an even more controversial philosopher, Jan Stachniuk. Both promising to bring Poland to greatness never seen before in its entire history..."
poland.4.a:0 "It is clear that the Marshal's work is done, we will be a democracy."
poland.4.b:0 "The Marshal's death must be harnessed and Poland propelled to greatness!"
poland.4.c:0 "Our enemies will take advantage of our mourning, bring forth the military government!"
poland.3.t:0 "원수께서 잠드시다"
poland.3.desc:0 "Crowds of size not remembered in ages gathered in city of Krakow to pay their last respects to the Marshal of Poland; her leader Józef Piłsudski. Despite some resistance from members of the catholic clergy that holds the historic building in custody he was burried in vault under Wawel Cathedral, the traditional place of rest of Polish kings and national heroes. Flocks of grieving Poles were accompanied by numerous foreign guests including official envoys from member-states of the Intermarium alliance as well Prussia and the U.K. More insightful eyes could also spot controversial Russian politician Alexander Kazembek amongst the guests."
poland.3.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
poland.5.t:0 "A Controversial grave"
poland.5.desc:0 "Death of Marshal Piłsudski emboldened his political opponents. Group of protesters gathered today before parliament building in Warsaw demanding removal of Piłsudski's body from Wawel vault claiming that the funeral was done against wishes of both the Catholic Church and the Polish nation. The illegal demonstrations were ended by police and some of the activists were arrested. There has been no official response from the Polish Episcopacy."
poland.5.a:0 "This doesn't bode well."
poland.6.t:0 "예술가 폭동"
poland.6.desc:0 "Unexpected unrest started in Krakow's Academy of Fine Arts where argument between groups of students over philosophical matters turned into open clashes. Supporters of classical academia and critique engaged in violent fights with acolites of Szukalski and his more free-spirited and less academic aproach to art. Debate was espacially heated becouse of political implications of the given arguments. Luckilly police was easilly subdue unruly student and everything ended without serious bodily harm to either side."

poland.7.t:0 "예술가 폭동"
poland.7.desc:0 "Unexpected unrest started in Krakow's Academy of Fine Arts where argument between groups of students over philosophical matters turned into open clashes. Supporters of classical academia and critique engaged in violent fights with acolites of Szukalski and his more free-spirited and less academic aproach to art. Debate was espacially heated becouse of political implications of the given arguments as well as Szukalski's position within goverment. Luckilly police was easilly subdue unruly student and everything ended without serious bodily harm to either side. Pro-academia students as well as some teachers expressed concern over police treating Szukalski's supporters way more leniently."
poland.7.a:0 "예술은 고통 속에서 태어난다."
poland.8.t:0 "민족 만신전"
poland.8.desc:0 "After many debates and revisions finally began first works on the \"Duchtynia\", a national monumental building which is to serve as crypt of proudest sons and daughters of the Polish nation as well as her spiritual center. Grand concrete structure designed by Leader himself is to be a seamless hybrid of ancient slavic burials and cutting edge architecture and technology. Despite work being more than likely many years from being finished, construction is already attracting criticism as a \"pagan temple in a heart of catholic nation\" as described in an official letter from Archbishops."
poland.8.a:0 "Wonderful way to honour our identity and our heroes."
poland.9.t:0 "PPS and PSL form a coalition"
poland.9.desc:0 "The election carried out by temporary government resulted in Ignacy Daszyński, leader of Polish Socialist Party, claiming the title of the president, as well as many members of both wings of the popular front getting seats in the senate and sejm. Despite that, the constitution still needed major changes for Poland to call herself a democratic country. So in order to ensure that reforms will be passed with little to no resistance from right-wing extremists and national collectivists, PPS, PSL-\"Piast\"" and PSL-\"Liberation\" formed the Democratic Popular Front and as a result have taken majority of the parliment."
poland.9.a:0 "Could this be the beggining of our freedom?"
poland.10.t:0 "강한 아우구스트"
poland.10.desc:0 "Cinemas across Prussia and Poland hits \"Augustus the Strong\" (German title: August der Starke, Polish title: August Mocny), a polish-prussian cooproduction. The epic is praised by critics for historical accuracy and attention to details in life of the german king of Poland. It is also seen by both sides as an attempt at warming relations between two nations. \nSadly premiere didn't went completly without incidents as acts of vandalism to the poster displays in some cinemas were reported. Clear link with communist activity isn't yet established but highly suspected."
poland.10.a:0 "May this be a symbol of a growing friendship."
poland.11.t:0 "현인들의 섬"
poland.11.desc:0 "Premiere of the last episode of the awaited \"Island of Sages\" (Wyspa Mędrców) movie serial didn't went without controversy. While adaptation of the first book in the series under the same title was praised for high production values and acting chops of Witold Roland as main antagonist, some criticised it as \"blantant propaganda\". Director, Leonard Buczkowski demented the accusations stating to be merely faithfully adapting source material which is already few years old. \"Was Maria Buyno-Arctowa trying to flatter current goverment writing her book eight years ago? If yes, powers of her mind are more superhuman than those possesed by her characters.\" Buczkowski answered in a press interview."
poland.11.a:0 "Wonderful series, as always."
poland.12.t:0 "Great findings in Biała!"
poland.12.desc:0 "In village of Biała nearby Lódź archeologists discovered an ancient relic: urn used by ancient slavs to burry ash of their dead. Well preserved artifact is covered in enigmatic symbols that will surely give our historians something to argue about and artists to spin into rushes of creatvity."
poland.12.a:0 "This will help us learn about our past."
poland.12.b:0 "Another pagan junk to the collection."
poland.13.t:0 "Writing Reform"
poland.13.desc:0 "Today marks the date when official Commission on National Font begins its works. While government is working tirelessly in its efforts to industrialise the nation and colectivise the farming, cultural aspect of transformations cannot be underestimated by no means. Alongside reform of education making it more suited for future poles well aware of their cultural and ethnic heritage, proposed was also smaller but quite interesting development. \n Unlike nations like Germany with fraktur or Britain with Gaelic script, Poland never managed to show its uniqueness by establishing suited for its language typeface. And how with merely using western tools can we create not just literature made in Poland but true Polish Literature?\nCommission emploing finest artists and grapical designer alongside scholars of polish language will try to create elegant typeface to use both in pring and handwriting. One at once simple, elegant and uniquely suited for specifics of our language."
