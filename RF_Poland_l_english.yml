#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC = "대전쟁 직후 이어진 독일과 러시아의 붕괴에 따라, 폴란드는 몇 세기에 걸친 외세의 지배라는 잿더미 속에서 다시 태어났습니다. 피우수트스키 장군이 이끄는 폴란드는 이른바 "인테르마리움"이라는 동유럽 방위협약을 형성함으로써 독일, 러시아, 체코슬로바키아에 이르는 주변의 위협을 물리치고 이겨냈습니다. 하지만 이것도 15년 전이니, 피우수트스키는 이제 늙었습니다. 암 투병으로 병상에 누운 그가 얼마나 버틸 진 알 수 없습니다만, 대원수가 자신의 최후의 전투에서 패배하는 것도 시간 문제에 불과합니다."

poland.2.t:0 "원수의 죽음"
poland.2.desc:0 "모두가 가장 두려워하던 일이 일어나고야 말았습니다. 우리가 사랑하는 폴란드의 원수 요제프 피우수트스키 원수가 69세의 나이로 간암과의 오랜 싸움 끝에 사망했습니다. 그는 슬픔에 잠긴 가족과 국가를 기로에 두고 떠났습니다. 폴란드는 명목상으로 민주적이였지만, 실제로는 그의 공공연한 영향력 아래 통치를 받아왔습니다. 그런 그가 떠났으니, 아무도 앞으로 무슨 일이 일어날지 확신하지 못하고 있습니다."

poland.3.desc:0 "오랜 시간 동안 대규모의 군중들은 그들의 지도자 피우수트스키 원수에게 마지막 경의를 표하기 위해 크라코프 시에 모였습니다. 몇몇 가톨릭 성직자들의 저항에도 불구하고, 그는 폴란드 왕들의 전통적인 장소인 와웰 대성당 아래에 묻혔습니다. 비탄에 잠긴 폴란드인 군중들은 영국과 프로이센 뿐만 아니라, 미엔미모제 동맹의 회원국의 공식 사절단을 포함한 수 많은 외국인들과 동행했습니다. 그 중에 러시아 정치인 알렉산더 카젬베크가 군중들 사이에서 논란이 되고 있는 것을 볼 수 있었습니다."

poland.8.desc:0 "After many debates and revisions finally began first works on the \"Duchtynia\", a national monumental building which is to serve as crypt of proudest sons and daughters of the Polish nation as well as her spiritual center. Grand concrete structure designed by Leader himself is to be a seamless hybrid of ancient slavic burials and cutting edge architecture and technology. Despite work being more than likely many years from being finished, construction is already attracting criticism as a \"pagan temple in a heart of catholic nation\" as described in an official letter from Archbishops."

poland.9.desc:0 "The election carried out by temporary government resulted in Ignacy Daszyński, leader of Polish Socialist Party, claiming the title of the president, as well as many members of both wings of the popular front getting seats in the senate and sejm. Despite that, the constitution still needed major changes for Poland to call herself a democratic country. So in order to ensure that reforms will be passed with little to no resistance from right-wing extremists and national collectivists, PPS, PSL-\"Piast\"" and PSL-\"Liberation\" formed the Democratic Popular Front and as a result have taken majority of the parliment."

The epic is praised by critics for historical accuracy and attention to details in life of the german king of Poland. It is also seen by both sides as an attempt at warming relations between two nations. \nSadly premiere didn't went completly without incidents as acts of vandalism to the poster displays in some cinemas were reported.

poland.11.desc:0 "Premiere of the last episode of the awaited \"Island of Sages\" (Wyspa Mędrców) movie serial didn't went without controversy. While adaptation of the first book in the series under the same title was praised for high production values and acting chops of Witold Roland as main antagonist, some criticised it as \"blantant propaganda\". Director, Leonard Buczkowski demented the accusations stating to be merely faithfully adapting source material which is already few years old. \"Was Maria Buyno-Arctowa trying to flatter current goverment writing her book eight years ago? If yes, powers of her mind are more superhuman than those possesed by her characters.\" Buczkowski answered in a press interview."

Alongside reform of education making it more suited for future poles well aware of their cultural and ethnic heritage, proposed was also smaller but quite interesting development. \n Unlike nations like Germany with fraktur or Britain with Gaelic script, Poland never managed to show its uniqueness by establishing suited for its language typeface.
